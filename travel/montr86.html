<h1>Montr&eacute;al, Columbus, July/August 1986</h1>

This time it is I going away and the others staying. But to start 
at the break in routine two days ago: an overnight boat trip.
Sheila's morning squash match with Rachel fell through, so we
went first to Summertown for picnic stuff. (In fact, we saw
Rachel in Summertown. She said that Hester's violin examiner
had been very hard, as well as ill-mannered, giving only one
distinction and four merits in a whole day of examining
(ten minutes a time), so Hester's missing a merit by just
four marks is a very good achievement under the circumstances.)
<p>
Back home to load the car, then down to the boat. We loaded
everything on, got ready to start, Sheila went off to take the
car home -- then nothing. Total non-response from the electrical
system. Not just a flat battery, but nothing at all. Sheila, who
hadn't quite gone, went to get help. While she was bringing
Phil back, the circuit suddenly came to life, and the engine
started perfectly. Phil came, decided it was a bad connection,
and cleaned the terminals. Off we went. Sheila left, we reversed
into the pool; and, as I changed gear, the engine died once again.
Fortunately, after we'd drifted for a while, Paul saw our plight,
took a line and brought us in, and fetched Phil again. This time
he located the trouble in the battery master switch, so took it
off and put in an unswitched terminal instead. Then he noticed
how badly the engine was idling, so turned the rate up a bit.
It was nearly 1.00 when we finally set off.
<p>
Sheila was halfway down the towpath looking for us. We raced her
back to Godstow. Since we were all hungry by then, we stopped
for lunch on the south bank in the sheep meadow just past the
ring road. Afterwards the kids played badminton while I emptied
out the water under the floorboards, and we set off again, in
blazing sunshine, up past Wytham hill.
<p>
Just before Swinford lock, Hester wanted the toilet. I'd intended
to put chemicals in it but forgotten, so we pulled up by a grassy
slope under a hill. The kids loved the place so we stopped for a
while. More badminton; Hester and Neill are getting quite
proficient. Then on through Swinford lock. The kids wanted a
village to buy comics, so we stopped just past the lock and
walked into Eynsham. Comics, drinks, and a walk round the pretty
town centre. By then it was too late to make for Bablockhythe,
our intended destination; we decided we liked Hester's grassy spot
so well that we went back there and tied up for the night, then
walked back to the Talbot for supper.
<p>
It wasn't very good -- underdone potatoes with textured fillings --
but it did satisfy hunger to some degree. We walked back to the
boat, got the beds ready, and it was a late bedtime for the kids
and quite an early one for us, tired. I had got a bit sunburnt,
and didn't have a totally restful night; my unzipped sleeping bag
came out  from underneath, so that I was lying on the rough
cushion.
<p>
Just before dawn it rained very hard, and we awoke to drips
coming in through assorted leaks. We breakfasted off bread rolls,
packed, played more badminton, and set off at 8.30 to potter
gently home again. By now the rain had stopped and the day was
broken cloud with patchy sunshine.
<p>
The return journey was quick and uneventful, getting us into
Medley by 10, the children driving the last stretch from Godstow,
after Sheila had left to get the car. We beat her to Medley this
time, but I was last off, after more baling and cleaning, carting
stuff out, filling the tank, and putting on the covers.
<p>
Back home. Instead of packing or thinking about this trip, I had
to see Jacinta, Dave and Tracey. By this stage I had a slight
temperature and felt quite bad. Dave had more than I could read
in a short time, so he came round in the evening at 8. And by
then I had finished reading it, despite also having cooked roast
chicken and mowed the front lawn and stuck the Stanley Spencer
postcards I bought in Eynsham into my scrapbook, and Sheila had
been for a run and taken Neill to choir practice (because
Matthew's family had gone on holiday without telling us). Dave
stayed till 9.30. I saw for the first time his new theorem. The
free group of countable rank has a permutation representation
which is <i>k</i>-transitive, the stabiliser of <i>k</i>+1 points is
trivial, and the free generators act as single cycles, and there
is an invariant <i>k</i>-error-correcting code.
<p>
I still managed to get packed before bedtime, which left, for
this morning, last-minute packing, watering the plants, washing
the dishes, etc. Sheila drove down (with much grumbling from
the boys about missing Transformers) and, after I'd packed up
some papers in College, they all saw me onto the airport bus.
<p>
<h4>1101</h4>

<blockquote>
Contemporary British art ---<br>
Rain-streaked concrete walls<br>
Of the airport underpass.
</blockquote>

So much for avoiding the queues at Terminal 4: it took us
twenty-five minutes to get through airport security. The
guards gave the Royal Wedding as reason enough, but there is
no doubt that security was much tighter than usual. They
opened my case, which they must have seen from the X-ray 
contained nothing but clothes; anything metal (keys, shaver)
was in my shoulder bag.
<p>
Prior to that, everyone except me had disembarked at the
central coach station, and the bus was nearly hijacked by a
long queue of people whose bus to Oxford was late.

<h4>1337</h4>
I am definitely not in a mood for extended writing. Boarding
the plane was a complete shambles, and we took off more than
half an hour late.
<p>
British Airways has replaced its live stewardesses used in the
safety demonstration with a video.
<p>
On the way down on the bus, I gave some thought to my talk.
I will speak on both themes of the conference, algebraic and
extremal. I'll start off by indicating how the hypotheses and
the problems with permutations closely parallel those for
subsets. I got as far as my general bound for <i>s</i>-distance sets
and Kiyota's Theorem. I must say something about geometric sets
and groups. I also hope to drag in (at that point, perhaps) the
vector transversals. This would perhaps make a good exit line.
<p>
The in-flight magazine has little but Royal Wedding guff; the
entertainment is pretty thin. (I'm listening to the 60s program
at the moment; it's loaded with Petula Clark, Dusty Springfield,
etc., and odd bits of Hollies and Searchers; nothing hard, and
only "Love Me Do" from the Beatles.) The film will be Clockwise.
I'm in an aisle seat, so no chance of watching the clouds go by.
Six and three quarter dead hours. I have books, though, and the
possibility of doing some mathematics, so I suppose I'll survive.

<h4>0950 (Eastern)</h4>
I assume I have the time right. There is no
information available. I'm hungry. I'd assumed that they would
serve up lunch very soon after leaving; but we are over an hour
and a half into the flight and there's absolutely no sign of it.
<p>
The Captain has just come on to tell us that we're going to be
even later. We're going much further north than usual (we've just
passed Benbecula) and are still being affected by a headwind. We
expect to arrive in Mirabel at about 1510. We will pass over the
southern tip of Greenland -- but even if I were in a window seat,
it's practically guaranteed that they'll be showing the film at
the time.
<p>
I've switched to the "Contemporary Music" channel. It's quite
remarkable how recording quality has improved in twenty years,
even if musical quality has plummeted.
<p>
They think to entertain us with in-flight videos: a combination
of still more Royal Wedding, British Airways services, and
trailers for films they're not going to show us. Me, I bought
Andrew Harvey's A Journey in Ladakh, but I'm finding it too
powerful a drug, too efficient at distracting attention from
what's going on around me -- just the reverse, I think, of
the effect that the experience underlying the book had on him.
<p>
Still no sign of lunch. The plane is almost completely full,
from which I infer that their service just isn't equipped to
cope with a full plane. I wonder if the same is true of the
emergency service, in case of a non-fatal accident.

<h4>1044</h4>
Lunch came twenty-five minutes ago. Such is modern travel,
eating predigested food and drinking wine at what may or may not
be half past ten in the morning. Lunch was egg mayonnaise,
steak (eaten before the starter, and only lukewarm then), and
fruit (oranges, grapes and melon balls in syrup -- I saved the
brightly-coloured melon balls until last, but that was a mistake,
they were totally lacking in flavour and texture by comparison
with the other fruit).
<p>
When I had coffee, I caught myself dithering about whether or
not to put milk in it. Fifteen years ago I dithered about sugar
before giving it up altogether. (Not a perfect analogy -- you can
have more or less sugar in your coffee, but milk is binary.)
I suppose the next step would be to give up coffee. I don't
quite know; I think alcohol might go first.
<p>
Andrew Harvey has reached Leh, and his mind is being expanded
(except that he doesn't put it in those terms of the sixties) by
the clarity of everything. The same that happened to Sheila in
Mexico City, and to me in small doses in Toowoomba -- an effect
of altitude? (Or, at least, partly so?) One could fantasize that
mountains which had sheltered meditating Buddhists for
twenty-three centuries might be more powerful than ordinary
mountains. But I don't believe there is an ordinary mountain.
<p>
Glimpses of cloudbanks out the window have the look of a distant
continent, one that exists but keeps itself aloof from us. It
seems that it doesn't matter to us what happens on that
sun-drenched strand. Does it? (This is a kind of koan. Perhaps
it should be refined.)
<p>
The video is showing one of the Tom and Jerry cartoons we put
on at the Bishop Kirk fete. Talking of fetes, two French-Canadians
in a party on the plane have birthdays today. One is 15.

<blockquote>
	In the cloud-continent<br>
	Glimpsed through the plane window<br>
	Life turns, laws hold,<br>
	But they are of no moment for us.<br>
	Are they?
</blockquote>

I haven't really captured it. The point of the riddle, the
reason it has anything in common with a koan, is that it isn't
even a question. But already there, leading off at a tangent,
is an instance of the dilemma. Should I worry out a pointed
formulation of that thought, or should I just record everything
uncritically? In any case, the cloud landscape is past, and only
a slightly lumpy haze is now visible.
<p>
To mathematics. The question on which I've slept for many nights
now is: How many sumfree sets are there? The Hausdorff--Besicovich
dimension of the set of sumfree sets is 
log<sub>2</sub>(limsup(<i>f<sub>n</sub></i>)<sup>(1/<i>n</i>)</sup>),
where <i>f<sub>n</sub></i> is the number of sumfree subsets of 1,...,<i>n</i>.
Why limsup, and how does liminf come into the picture? But, of
course, I am convinced that the limit exists, and that its value
is 1/2. But the question did lead me onto something else. What
conditions on a graph ensure that the number of cocliques is
bounded by <i>c<sup>n</sup></i>, for some <i>c</i>&lt;2? The particular answer 
which I hope will ensure that is that the minimum and maximum valency differ
by a constant factor and are prescribed (and not too small). So,
let <i>c</i>(<i>d</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>)=limsup(<i>k<sub>n</sub></i>)<sup>(1/<i>n</i>)</sup>, where <i>k<sub>n</sub></i> is the number of
cocliques in an <i>n</i>-vertex graph with minimum valency at least
<i>d</i><sub>1</sub> and maximum valency at most <i>d</i><sub>2</sub>. Then, 
for example, <i>c</i>(1,1)=sqrt(2), <i>c</i>(1,2)=(1/2)(1+sqrt(5)). I think 
it would suffice for me to know that 
lim <i>c</i>(<i>d</i>,2<i>d</i>)=sqrt{2}. I'd like to
try this out on people at the conference. But it is obviously
not enough to specify maximum valency only, and neither is it
enough to specify minimum valency (a star has 2<sup>(<i>n</i>-1)</sup>+1 
cocliques).
<p>
The point is that, if a sumfree set contains <i>d</i> of the first <i>n</i>
numbers, then the patterns of exclusions in any interval of
length greater than 2<i>n</i> is a graph with minimum valency <i>d</i> and
maximum valency 2<i>d</i> (and, indeed, almost all vertices having
valency 2<i>d</i>, if the interval is long).
<p>
No, that isn't quite right, we must assume that almost all
vertices have valency <i>d</i>.
<p>
It's probably enough to consider regular graphs anyway. For the
interval can be bent into a circle, and the resulting graph made
regular, without changing very much the number of cocliques. In
fact, more is true. The graph obtained in this way is cyclic,
hence vertex-transitive, so it has 1-factors (if the number of
vertices is even, which we may assume to be the case).

<h4>1203</h4> 
I started to watch the film. But even the new design of
British Airways headphones, though more comfortable than the
old ones and far more stylish, couldn't really make the ordeal
worth enduring; and, from so far back, the only way I can see
the screen is to lean out into the aisle and get decapitated by
every passing passenger. I think John Cleese will just have to
do his thing without me. Music is tolerable, because it doesn't
matter if you miss bits.
<p>
To put it another way, it's easier in the mountains, the facts
of physiology are on your side. People have, it seems, always
regarded mountains as holy, but those who really care haven't
been afraid to go to them. There are examples, though, of the
mountain which has never been scaled, perhaps guarded by a
vengeful god.
<blockquote>
"When there is a rainbow in the mountains," Wangchuk said, "we
say the mountains are dancing. The rainbows are the scarves they
wind round their wrists." (p. 40).
</blockquote>
Or do the mountains always dance, but sometimes the dance does not
require scarves wrapped round the wrists?

<h4>1232</h4>
I gave John Cleese another chance, but there is more to it
than the discomfort or the difficulty; I'm just not hooked by it.
The point of a cinema is that there is absolutely no distraction,
no possibility of doing anything else. But why then is television
so addictive?

<h4>1453</h4>
My first poem, this morning, was a small poem, a poem of
bitterness and anger. This thought was clear when I read the
Rinpoche's answer to Andrew Harvey.
<p>
His question isn't so different from mine. And if I can gloss
the answer just slightly: there is a good way of working, of
writing, of creating, a way which does no violence to the creator;
but it is very unlikely that it will be recognized as valid
artistic expression in our culture. Therefore it must be done, if
need drives us, without expectations. That state of mind,
perhaps more than the creation itself, is then of value.

<h4>1556</h4> On the ground in Montr&eacute;al, sitting in the airport bus
waiting for departure. The ride into "downtown" (in England it
would be a literal translation of "centre-ville") should mean
more to me now than on my first visit, seeing that I have a
better idea of the geography of what I'll be seeing. It is a warm,
humid, cloudy day, but the rain they promised us has held off, or
stopped, and a weak sun is shining. In its openness, Canada
looked brighter than England does.
<p>
The usual strange procedure for disembarking at Mirabel: little
pigs come and attach themselves to nipples on the big pig, suck
out the passengers, then run away and spew them out into the
huge garbage bin. Getting through that was straightforward except
that I'd forgotten to tick the noes on the Customs form, I
suppose having assumed that not ticking the yeses would have the
same effect.
<p>
Paying my bus fare reminds me that I'm in a country where the
smallest banknote is worth about a tenth of the value of the
smallest English note. My wallet will soon run out of space --
at least, I hope it stays that way. One thing I intended to
bring but forgot was travellers' cheques. (Another was nail
scissors, also handkerchiefs, vitamin C, and other such
inessentials.)
<p>
The door is shut, but the bus is in no hurry to leave. There is
no adjustable ventilation. What use is materialism without
adjustable ventilation?
<p>
I felt I had left something behind me as I disembarked. I wasn't
wearing a coat!

<h4>1611</h4>
To the north, a rim to such featureless mountains that it
is a level pale blue line above the dark blue of the forest.
Nearer, dead ground between the highway lanes carries dry grass
and yellow-flowering weed. The gentlest midsummer colours
imaginable. But now, as we swing onto the main road, the trees
are darker. Stands of forest alternate with meadows bordered with
derelict hedges, spindly creeper-covered trees. Small patches
of crops, far from ripe. The forests are very unkempt, too thick,
and choked with undergrowth and dead trees. I think they might be
boggy underfoot too: there are rushes by the roadside, and
streams crossing. If this is their natural state, who would have
dreamed them worth penetrating?
<p>
Little clusters of buildings flash past, European-style houses
or farms with American barns, and now an out-of-town shopping
center and an industrial estate, a huge factory. A football
game with a few dozen spectators. Then bigger, greener fields
and darker, taller, better-tended woods. One motorway crosses
another, on three huge bridges, or that's what it seems from
one side. But the bridges lead to a dead end.
<p>
Now across the Thousand Islands bridge onto the first island.
More built-up now, but still not urban. Still very flat.
<p>
The second river, with its one big round island. We're on a
fairly primitive, very bumpy, six-lane highway which yet has a
new and unfinished look to it. And now a glimpse of the north
slope of the mountain with its huge church and the city
sprawling below.

<h4>2051</h4>
I won't go on late. My eyelids are beginning to need propping up.
<p>
To continue: The bus carried on, parallel to the railway line
under that odd, very straight bank, over a most amazing
collection of concrete spaghetti, and to its stopping point
down town. Out I tumbled and got my bearings, amid huge buildings
whose reflecting windows distorted both shape and colour, so I
could watch someone resembling me yet being wholly other walking
along going the same way I was. But the most remarkable thing
was that, at ten to five on a Saturday afternoon, the town was
empty and all the shops were shut. I found my way to the Metro
(harder than it should have been since the well-signposted way
through the shopping arcade was closed), paid a dollar and went
on, not forgetting my correspondence ticket. Suffice to say that,
after a most straightforward trip, I arrived, signed on, got my
room key, and found my room.
<p>
There was still plenty of time for a run, so I set of over
Mt. Royal, a route I'd taken before. The long steady pull up
was fine, I found myself running well. I decided to risk the
plunge over the edge and, to my dismay, got totally and utterly
lost. It was a blessing in disguise, because it gave me some most
enjoyable rock scrambling on the cliff. I found my way down, and
came back a quick way, having taken 46mins for the entire trip.
<p>
Then I showered, changed, phoned Ivo Rosenberg to tell him I'm
here, and went out to eat, heading in the direction of the
Kinh Do, which I duly found. The meal was very good, but
especially the delicious soup, hot thin soup with finely chopped
fresh vegetables and herbs thrown in.
<p>
Tired. Must stop.
<p>
Oh, before I forget, article by David Tritton in New Scientist
on work of John Miles on a dynamical system exhibiting chaotic
behaviour in response to a periodic applied force (a spherical
pendulum, in fact). Relevant reference for the sumfree opus.

<h4>27/7/86, 0632</h4>
A good night's sleep -- the principle of tiring
myself out worked well. The few times I awoke (usually because
of people talking outside my window) I was able to get straight 
back to sleep again.
<p>
I didn't give any description of my surroundings. I suppose that,
having seen it all before, it seems so familiar as not to need
description. (Apart from missing the path on top of Mt. Royal
yesterday, I've found everything exactly where I expected it
to be.) The day was too hazy to yield really spectacular views
from the top to the mountain, but the sea of haze in the west
into which the sun sank was quite impressive. I noticed that, in
spite of the unripe fields I'd seen earlier, the rowans on top
of the mountain had very bright orange berries already. In a
different climate, the balance of timing in the growth of plants
must work differently.
<p>
I finished Andrew Harvey's book. My first reaction is that,
despite the enormous amount of wisdom contained in it, it is
really too glib. A foreigner on a brief visit can monopolise
the time of two Rinpoches of great eminence and can master both
the doctrine and the basic steps of meditation in a couple of
weeks with no setbacks and no difficulties -- this seems less
honest to me than Peter Matthieson's account in The Snow Leopard.
It is also verging on being too clever. Many of the characters
seem as if they are there to throw light on the author's
development, rather than for any reasons of their own. In
contradiction to the teaching he professes, the most enormous
amount of ego fills the book. (So no doubt in any book, and
that makes it readable to us in the West, fits it in with our
own tradition; but more honesty would present this as a struggle.)
<p>
But of course, it must be said that I couldn't put the book down;
I read it waiting to go through immigration, waiting for the bus
at Laurier, etc.
<p>
The room was like an oven when I came, but after having the
windows open all night it is much cooler. Only one mosquito came
in; and now a gentle breeze occasionally stirs a tracery of
leaves against a pale blue sky. Facilities are minimal -- towels
but no soap; sheet and bedspread but no blanket. But plenty of
cupboards (though no coathangers).
<p>
The number of grey squirrels is amazing. I just looked out the
window and saw three of them playing in the courtyard between
this building and the next. The park was full of them yesterday,
and they seemed quite tame.

<h4>0900</h4>
Breakfast time.
<p>
I worked for a while, finishing writing my talk, and then set
out to look for the shops that Robert Woodrow and I found the
day we went to Qu&eacute;bec City. It's a glorious day, sunny and so
clear; the view from in front of the main University building,
over the ocean-like plain, was full of nearby tall buildings
shining in the sharply-angled light, and varied greens of trees
and bushes. Several things made me wish I'd brought my camera:
shadows of maple leaves on a Children Crossing sign; a grey path
where the paving was breaking up and revealing irregular patches
of bright red foundation.
<p>
I think I mentioned in my travel diary last time I was here how
slowly the joggers go. It's certainly true. They run a little
faster on top of the mountain, but in the streets they amble
along. One runner passed me (only just!), going downhill, with a
friend beside him on a bike on the road, carrying out a perfectly
normal conversation.
<p>
A man leaned to one side, out into the road, and spat. He then
stayed leaning there for half a minute, as if one leg was
shorter than the other.
<p>
After a false start, I found the shops. There was one Patisserie
Provencal, which seemed much too high-class for my immediate
needs (elegantly packed chocolates, etc.); but further down there
was a 24 hour grocer, which, though quite as bad as such places
usually are, could supply me with juice (reconstituted), bread
(North American, not French), peperoni, fruit, milk, buns, etc.
At present I'm sitting on a bench just outside, putting it away
steadily while I write this.
<p>
How wonderful, to sink my teeth into a juicy, chilled Granny Smith!

<h4>1038</h4>
I walked back up the street and, on impulse, went into the
so-called American Historical Museum. What a swizz! Each word of
the title was true only of a minority of the exhibit; and I
think nothing satisfied all three. More than half of the building
was devoted to dioramas of the early Christian life and worship
in the Catacombs, with supposedly accurate costumes (though I
have my doubts -- why were two Bethlehem shepherds listening to
an Apostle preach?), with reproductions of the pictures and
engravings on the walls (presumably accurate, though tidied up a
bit), set off very gloomy tunnels so that many of the exhibits
were invisible anyway. The rest consisted of a few dioramas of
French-Canadian history prior to 1760, the founder of the
Oratory being sculpted by an artist (art within art, with a photo
of the actual event to demonstrate the authenticity of the model!),
two wildly inaccurate modern scenes (one of the Apollo 11
astronauts, who landed on the moon in 1969, being greeted by
President Kennedy, who died in 1963 after predicting their
achievement), and several scenes from the life of the Holy Family.
The whole thing confirmed any prejudices against French Canadians
I might have had far beyond what an outsider could possibly
believe reasonable.
<p>
I left and walked up the mountain. On the way up, I checked on
one jogger, who was actually running just under half as fast
again as I was walking (and I was walking briskly but without
the smallest strain).
<p>
I'm now sitting at a picnic table in a beautiful grove of silver
birch and maple on top of an outlying point of the mountain. I
had a little mid-morning snack of marshmallows and an apple.
While I was eating, a squirrel came up exploring. I gave her
(him?) some bits of apple, and she sat on the table eating them
and scattering the peel all around. I put one piece just a few 
inches from my hand, to see how close she'd come. She came up
and reached out tentatively for it, which had the effect of
knocking it closer to me. She plucked up courage and tried
again; same thing, same result. It was now too close for comfort,
so I knocked it away a bit. She did a bunk, but came back for it.
I gave her the core, which she left on the ground after nibbling
it clean. Once she was convinced there was no more, she ran
gracefully away across the grass.
<p>
I can't get my mind to focus on this insight I had on the plane,
getting an upper bound for sumfree sets by counting cocliques
in cyclic graphs. But I'm sure there is promise!

<h4>1241</h4>
I wandered down, across through the forest to the pavilion,
looked at the view, walked up the hill behind, read the first Q
story, had lunch.
<p>
I must stop slagging off the French-Canadians quite so much for
the gothic content of their literature. Q's story was just as
bad, and of course the same occurs in Dickens. Though of course
the Celts give it quite a different flavour from the Catholics.
<p>
Early lunch because I'm intending to run this afternoon before
registration. Part of the purpose of this walk, indeed, is to
find a way down the mountain that is feasible to run. And I have
found the bottom of one; so I guess I'll have to go round the
other way. I found it by coming down a chimney in the cliff, far
more precipitous than the route I took yesterday. Steadying
myself after a slip, I saw a small raspberry growing out of a
crack in the rock by my hand.
<p>
Walking through the forest at the top of the cliff was marvellous.
Behind the green leaves, never out of awareness, was the blue of
the flat landscape. Filling the silence was the sound of a
carillon blending with an Oriental chant. I followed the sound
of the latter and, at the foot of the hill, came upon a Hare
Krishna circus. It was such a mixture. Sixteen booths under
brightly coloured awnings, sense and nonsense inextricably
jumbled beneath. A careful account of how the teaching of Jesus
("My kingdom is not of this world") was changed and perverted; a
good account of the reasons for vegetarianism (omitting, however,
the need to balance amino acids); a statement that science has
failed, and must be rejected in favour of mysticism, because
(a) theories of the Big Bang (ten years old, but no mention of
that) involve a naked singularity, and (b) scientists can't yet
predict the entire developmental path of an organism from its
genetic make-up; the claim that reincarnation must be seriously
considered because it is America's fastest-growing belief about
what happens after death (with a long list of Hollywood starlets
and pop singers who subscribe to it); a long history of His Grace
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada; a free food counter (I wish
I'd known before I had lunch; I didn't enjoy the dry bread and
peperoni at all). The whole thing calls itself the Festival of
India, which is on a par with the American Historical Museum.
<p>
I forgot to mention. I had to laugh out loud at the name of Buddha
up there with Krishna, Jehovah, Allah, et al. Nobody turned a
hair.

<h4>1331</h4>
But whatever else you want to say about them, it's certainly
true that their food is delicious! Yes, glutton that I am, I
lined up for some. It consisted of pasta and chickpeas in tomato
and herbs, some sweetish brown sludge-cake, green salad, poppadums,
and farfar (cooked by a man at the back of the tent while we
watched -- he had a giant wok full of oil; he would throw in a
packetful of farfar, which would sink, and then turn it once with
a curved instrument, on which it would rise to the top like
multicoloured flowers in a bowl of water), and a delicious cold
pink squash. I sat on a chair on the front of the stage to eat
it, in the blazing sun, while the speakers poured out
<blockquote>
	Hare Krishna Hare Krishna<br>
	Krishna Krishna Hare Hare<br>
	Hare Rama Hare Rama<br>

over and over again, in a variety of styles, and a volume set to
carry to the top of the mountain. Sporadically, people around me
would try to clap the complicated rhythms for a few bars.
<p>
I have to love these people better than the priests up on their
mountain. (That museum, so close to the Oratory with its Quebec
flag, had to be in the priests' control.) However inconsistent
they are, it is a sign that they are throwing everything out to
try to catch my attention. They don't love scientists, which
isn't easy to forgive, but they love most people.
<p>
The recorded music gave way to live, two girls singing Hare Krishna
with beautiful voices, then a little talk about the event -- it is
a festival dedicated to Juggernaut, "one of the names of God"
(like Buddha: it is true that Buddha is deified as an avatar of
Vishnu in some parts of Hinduism) and will continue till about
8.30 -- then more music, more traditional Indian, with the
opening- and closing-doored harmonium, side drum, and finger
cymbals. The drummer is playing a wonderful intricate repeated
figure.

<h4>1636</h4> 
While they were playing, I heard a noise behind me, and
turned and saw a huge tower, dazzling in green and red, on a
wagon on the grass. Suddenly the place came alive; monks who had
been in procession with the tower moved among the people, singing,
dancing, and clapping. The excitement lifted the performers to
greater heights. But they didn't get the whole crowd to come
alive, and when finally the music stopped, and we were given a
repeat of the welcoming speech, I decided it was time to move on.
<p>
Back at the residence, who should I see walking down the road but
Peter Frankl, with a stranger who turned out to be Michel's son.
<p>
I set off straight away for a run. It really was too soon after
all that stuffing myself with food: I got a stitch after five
minutes. It went off after a minute's rest, breathing and bending,
but continued to niggle for a while.
<p>
The loosely metalled road I've crossed a couple of times in
different places actually stretches all the way from the bottom
of the mountain to the top, and is much used by cyclists and
walkers. It goes at a gentle but scarcely varying slope for quite
a long way. A fairly broad path turning off uphill at one point
I decided to call the Way of Zen, because it makes it possible
to reach the top in one lifetime. (Anyone who has run up the road
on a day as hot as this would agree that it takes many lifetimes.)
I ran up at a fair pace, faster than several cyclists. The loop
round the top was really spectacular; I can see why people pay
to do it by horse-drawn carriage. Coming down, I took a short cut
down the steps, and stopped off for a cooling glass of the Hare
Krishna people's iced orange squash. Both weakenings punished me
by making my body seize up so that running afterwards was much
harder. I ran for 63 minutes, not including the two stops.

<h4>2058</h4> 
After I'd showered and changed, I went out and sat on the
step for a while, and thought about sumfree sets, somewhat
inconclusively. Then I decided that if anyone were here, they
would have entered the building containing the offices from the
back. So I went up there. Sure enough, there was Michel, talking
to Fuji-Hara, with more people arriving all the time. Soon they
took us through into a separate room, where soft drinks, fruit
and nibbles were provided free (they couldn't compete with the
Krishna people, though!) and we talked there for a while. I
watched a lovely orange sunset flecked with purple clouds while
talking to Steve Smith and Rick Wilson. But I bowed out soon
afterwards, feeling that familiar drooping so characteristic of
jet-lag.

<h4>28/7/86, 0618</h4>
 Woke at 5 after a good night's sleep, dreaming
about Hottentotenpotentatentante. I lay in a near doze until
just before 6 when I got up to do yoga. Problem: the floor is
so hard that back rolls are impossible, hence I don't get loose
and my attempt at a shoulder stand was total disaster.
<p>
But, for all that, I feel well, not too stiff. I'm making a
fourth meal out of the $15 worth of food I bought yesterday
morning (I was spending money too fast over the last two days!).
Then some work before it's time to go and talk.

<h4>0841</h4> 
Last night Michel took great delight in showing me a
newspaper article about Australian men who put "objects" up
their rectums, giving feeble excuses when they have to go to
the doctor to have them taken out. He also spread consternation
among Steve and Rick by saying something to them which demanded
a reply but which neither of them could understand in the least.
<p>
Today is again gloriously sunny. I'm told that the rain stopped
about half an hour before my plane touched down. I think, though,
that these pages will fill much more slowly from now on. In less
than an hour I will be giving the opening talk of the conference.

<h4>1855</h4> 
Some now, more later maybe.
<p>
My talk went well, though perhaps I went too deep too early with
all that character theory. But it produced an answer. Someone
(whose name I must find out) observed that, if 2<i>s</i> is the correct
exponent in the case <i>s</i>=1, then it is in general. For let 
<i>F</i><sub>1</sub> be a set of <i>c</i>(<i>n</i>/<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup> 
permutations of {1,...,<i>n</i>/<i>s</i>} with one distance;
then the direct sum of <i>s</i> copies of <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> is a set of
(<i>c</i>(<i>n</i>/<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup><i>s</i></sup> permutations of 
{1,...,<i>n</i>} with <i>s</i> distances. The
good thing is that in my bound the constant <i>c<sub>s</sub></i> differs from 
this by a smaller order of magnitude than for the Ray-Chaudhuri or
Wilson bound or its derivative (exponential, as opposed to
factorial).
<p>
Rest of the talks nice, not stunning.
<p>
Had lunch in a grotty "chalet suisse", with Bannai, Ito and
Terwilliger -- chicken and chips and beer. Afterwards, in the
tea break, I got everything I need (I think): postcards, soap,
dental floss, writing paper, vitamin C (got postcards at lunch).
<p>
Michel conjectured that if there exists a <i>L</i>-clique and an
<i>L</i>-coclique in <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> with product of cardinalities 
<i>n</i>!, then <i>L</i>={0, 1,...,<i>t</i>-1} or 
<i>L</i>={<i>t</i>,<i>t</i>+1,...,<i>n</i>-2}. I have one
counterexample: <i>D</i><sub>8</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> in 
<i>S</i><sub>4</sub>, with <i>L</i>={0,2} and {1}.
<p>
After the last talk (Peter's, on Erd&ouml;s-Ko-Rado, and one of the
best), I ran over the mountain with him. We ran right to the top,
which took 64 minutes, longer than he had intended -- if we'd come
straight down from the car park, it would have been about right.
Slow by my standards: my breathing scarcely perceptible on the way
up. We saw one pair of really serious runners near the top. (The
higher you go, the faster they run!) 

<h4>2150</h4>
Back from the wine and cheese party, an excellent affair with
much more than just wine and cheese: ham and salami, salads, lots
of fruit, and coffee and some magnificent cheesecakes.
<p>
Ivanov invited me to visit Moscow; Michel wanted me to come to
Columbus with him for a couple of days after the conference.
Possibilities may be opening up around me. I really do like
travelling! but, modulo the American visa problem, Columbus would
mean the end of any dream of losing myself in the Canadian wilds
for a few days -- but with Bannai, Singhi, etc., it's too good
a chance to pass up. Ivo Rosenberg has asked one of his students
to find out from the American consulate just how difficult it
would be for me to get a visa.
<p>
An impression: a transmitter of some sort on Mt. Royal, painted
grey and surrounded by grey railings, in dappled sunlight through
the trees, seemed to be wreathed in smoke.
<p>
I was going to work tonight, but it may have to get left until
the morning. I have to write my paper and read Steve Smith's.
His talk, incidentally, was as good as he usually is, explaining
very clearly the different aspects of the (Buekenhout)
geometry/(simple) group interface.
<p>
Tomorrow I'm chairing the afternoon session. There is also a
problem session, to which I must give some thought.

<h4>28/7/86, 0943</h4>
I woke at about six, feeling raring to go. So I
got up and wrote my paper for the conference. In fact, I
adjourned for breakfast at 8 having not quite finished, but
polished it off soon afterwards. It is a kind of mirror image of
my Leeuwenhorst paper, covering much the same ground but proving
the things ignored there and vice versa, as seemed appropriate
for the conference. I reversed the order in the section on
bounds, giving the example first. The character theory bound
reduces the ratio between upper and lower bounds from factorial
to exponential, which perhaps makes it more worthwhile.
<p>
Last night, too, I had been through Steve Smith's paper, making
some comments, either favourable or nit-picking.
<p>
Today is overcast: not heavy cloud, more like thick haze. Looking
out of the window at breakfast time, one could believe one was
in mist-shrouded mountains; the effect of the haze was amplified
by the dirty windows.
<p>
I feel my duty is discharged now. I've had my plane ticket copied,
given Michel my paper and Steve's with comments, and can now
listen to F&uuml;redi's lecture (mainly an enormous list of results
on Erd&ouml;s' ex(<i>n,H</i>) function) with no guilt at writing in my diary.
<p>
Actually, he distracted me momentarily then (I use the word in the
English sense) by talking about the "sunflower method", which I
recognize from Peter Frankl's lectures at Caltech but which still
seems to me to be very powerful and waiting for applications.

<h4>1545</h4>
At lunch I ran over the mountain again, skipping the loop to
the top, in 42 minutes. I had to be back to chair the afternoon
session, and indeed I only just made it even with the shorter run.
Also, with  more than 30 miles in four days, I'm well above recent
average. But these were really rationalisations of my tiredness
when I hit the ridge; I'd run fast up the hill, much faster than
with Peter yesterday, and it was a hot and humid day. But I'm
pleased with the run.

<h4>2140</h4> I chaired the afternoon session without mishap. Perhaps the
most interesting thing to emerge was that Ceccherini and Tallini
have constructed projective space analogues of Steiner systems
with all reasonable parameters over any countable field. (An
obvious necessary condition is 2<i>k</i>&lt;=<i>v</i>+<i>t</i>-1, since two 
blocks must meet in at most a (<i>t</i>-1)-space.) The construction is simple.
Enumerate <i>t</i>-spaces and <i>k</i>-spaces. At the <i>n</i>th stage, if the
<i>n</i>th <i>t</i>-space is contained in a block, do nothing; otherwise, 
choose the first <i>k</i>-space which contains it but none of the (finitely
many) earlier <i>t</i>-spaces, and add it as a block.
<p>
Visa: it seems that it is possible, given a letter from the
University (which Eiichi has agreed to provide, though of course
it can't be on Ohio State letterhead) and several hours waiting
around at the US Consulate, which is at the Place d'Armes metro
station. And a photograph is required, but I'm assured I can get
it taken there.
<p>
In the problem session, after dithering round considering various
things, I posed the question about asymmetric elements in complete
sumfree sets mod <i>n</i>, an old favourite.
<p>
Notes from running. Both yesterday and today, I saw a chipmunk on
the path. They are much rarer than squirrels, as perhaps befits
their better looks. Another dig at the French: How French it is
to have a Mus&eacute;e de la chasse et de la nature!
<p>
Tonight we went to the Chinese buffet, all paid for except for
taxis and drinks. So the evening cost $8, whereas the meal price
was a very cheap $7 and some. I haven't the capacity I once had:
two large platefuls rendered me uncomfortable, despite having
missed lunch. It was quite good plain Chinese, no particular
subtlety. I thought of Jacinta when Richard Anstee mentioned a
dish he'd had in Florida called "Death by Chocolate" (apropos of
the chocolate ice cream they had at the buffet). One little
bit of excitement on the way back, when the taxi driver took us
to entirely the wrong place.
<p>
Kiyota is weighing on my mind. I must do something about writing
that paper. If the worst comes to the worst I must take it on
holiday with me and do some there.

<h4>30/7/86, 0645</h4>
The toilet paper here, and the paper towels, are
perhaps the thinnest I have ever come across. It seems
counterproductive; one uses an enormously greater length of paper
when it's so fine.
<p>
Incidentally, I seem to be revealed as a "big chooser" in Knuth's
sense, though this may be an accident of the particular cubicle
I use (the first one), where the larger roll is nearer to hand
and turns more easily.
<p>
A nice simple problem from Kalai. In projective 3-space over a
commutative field, if 
<i>l</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>l<sub>s</sub></i>, 
<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>m<sub>s</sub></i> are lines with
<i>l<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;cap&nbsp;<i>m<sub>j</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;emptyset 
if and only if <i>i</i>=<i>j</i>, we must have <i>s</i>&lt;=6.
The problem is to prove this over non-commutative fields (even
the quaternions would make him happy).

<h4>1053</h4>
Today it's raining for the first time (though it tried hard
enough while we were waiting for the taxi last night). We started
early, to fit in Clement Lam's lecture (to avoid having him talk
on Saturday when everyone will have gone). 
<p>
A nice argument told me by Noga Alon: Suppose you want to cover
the unit sphere by strips of finite width. Then the sum of the
widths must be at least 1. Proof: Project up onto a hemisphere
and note that, by magic, the area depends only (and linearly) on
the width of the strip!
<p>
Eiichi's new concept is that of a rigid spherical <i>t</i>-design. <i>X</i>
fails to be rigid if, for every positive epsilon, there is a perturbation
<i>X</i>' of <i>X</i>, its points distant less than epsilon from the points of
<i>X</i>, which is a <i>t</i>-design but not a rotation of <i>X</i>. 
Any tight design is rigid but not conversely; however, it seems that rigid 
designs are fairly restricted (e.g., bounded in size or number of
isomorphism types given <i>t</i> and the dimension).
<p>
On present appearances it looks as if I might have to type my own
invitation to Columbus on one of the typewriters in the
department! The secretaries are all on holiday.
<p>
This room (Salle Ernest Counier) is painted lilac-grey, with the
arches picked out in maroon and the beams in puce.
Daylight-coloured lights alternate with yellowish ones. It is
illegal to have more than 180 people in the room, but we're
quite OK.
<p>
Light on O'Nan's Lemma from Tatsuro's talk. If <i>X</i> is a transitive
permutation group and <i>Y</i> a subset of <i>X</i>, then <i>Y</i> is 
uniformly transitive if and only if <i>Y</i> is a <i>T</i>-design in the 
conjugacy-class association scheme on <i>X</i>, where <i>T</i> is the set of 
all non-trivial irreducible constituents of the permutation character. 
O'Nan's Lemma is immediate (though the proof of the above assertion is much 
harder than the direct proof of O'Nan's Lemma!). But also you see that
<i>t</i>-homogeneous groups are particular kinds of <i>t</i>-designs.

<h4>1252</h4>
Clement Lam estimates 2300 days (six and a half years) of
CPU time on a VAX-11/780 to complete the search for a projective
plane of order 10. He is now writing a program to put it on a Cray.

<h4>1819</h4>
Bilingual signs: In the shower, both taps are labelled "C".
Presumably "cold" and "chaud".
<p>
After Clement's talk, I asked a few people what they'd do if
offered a month on a Cray. Michel had an immediate answer: he'd
look for his perfect matroid design on 183 points, with lines and
planes of size 3 and 13 respectively.
<p>
Michel also said at lunch that A. V. Ivanov's presence (an
accident: the other Ivanov was asked) and Clement Lam's talk
(another accident) might be a happy conjunction -- if the Moscow
group get to work on the plane of order 10, they might halve the
estimated completion date (which Clement puts at two years now).
<p>
I used a chunk of the free afternoon running, up the hill again.
I was once again wooden at the start, something that hasn't
happened while I've been in Montr&eacute;al. But I was only slightly
slower at the start, and soon had speeded up to the same pace as
yesterday. I wonder whether it was the weather (cold and windy,
though no longer raining), starting from a desk instead of
changing after hurrying back to my room, or the very tight
constricting socks. Anyway, I suppose the cool helped after a
while. I sprinted to the top of the mountain. On the way down,
I got a nasty feeling in my right thigh, but it held off and I
charged flat out along Edouard Montpetit to the residences, to
finish as fresh as anything, pulse scarcely 95 after a minute.
I didn't bother looking at the view at all, but I passed
everything in sight. The time was 10 minutes faster than
when I did it with Peter.
<p>
The other thing on the afternoon's programme was writing comments
on the new triple paper. I still don't like it. In fact, what I
had to do was to extract comments from my letters of December and
January to Michel and Peter, and put them into suitable form for
a paper.
<p>
Tonight we have an extra session on association schemes. I went
and bought some lunch and am eating it in the common room. There's
more than I can eat but some will do for breakfast tomorrow, to
get me off to an early start in the direction of the American
consulate. Fingers crossed. It just occurred to me, I have to
come back into Canada too! I hate crossing frontiers!

<h4>2152</h4>
A long, long evening. We went on for getting on for
2 1/2 hours altogether.
<p>
Walking back, I saw the searchlight flashing in the sky. It's
the first time I've noticed it on this side of the mountain --
probably because of the clouds giving it something to shine on.

<h4>31/7/86, 0810</h4>
Last night Michel was getting into a bit of trouble
translating Russian and coming up with words of assorted
languages. 
<p>
I woke this morning at about 6.20 feeling more tired than usual,
the one morning I have to be up early. I dressed and set off,
eating my breakfast on the way to the Mont-Royal metro station.
By traversing the start of my route up the mountain, I
established that I run 2.3 times as fast as I walk, though one
jogger who passed me on the way was running only 1.4 times as
fast. Then down through a fairly seedy part of town (the Rue du
Bullion suggests interesting scenarios) to the metro for Place
d'Armes. Then I was faced with an incredible labyrinth both above
and under the ground, up and down escalators, through doors, past
shops; but, strangely enough, I didn't have to ask the way until
I was within 30 paces of the place I was looking for. (Its
presence was advertised on a big sign which I'd missed, but not
on the directory of the tower block of which it is on the
bottom.) I wouldn't have done so well, or been prepared to stray
so far from the metro station, but for having looked it up in
the phone book this morning and finding the keyword Desjardins.
(This had worried me at the time; I couldn't find a street of
that name anywhere near the Place d'Armes on the map -- but it
is one of these huge underground shopping complexes that
proliferate in Montr&eacute;al. The office opens at 8.30, and there are
just five people ahead of me in the queue. (It was six, but one
was persuaded that he needed a photo, and went off. The person
immediately in front of me had, like me, sought out a photo
machine before joining the queue; but he had mistakenly got one
portrait photo for his two dollars and had to sit again. I had
let him get back in front of me by stopping for orange juice.)
<p>
I'm about halfway through the Q stories now. I can begin to see
why he appeals to Helene Hanff. There is no mucking about with
description or poetry or anything like that. Still there is an
air of the supernatural about most of the stories, be it just
the colour of the sky or the effect of two bottles of wine.
<p>
But what a sign of the times, to be appointed by the Government
to a chair at Cambridge! There must be an even more interesting
story concealed by those few words. The cover blurb goes on to
say how he became a very popular lecturer, hinting that it was
to the surprise, even against the opposition, of the entrenched
dons.

<h4>0949</h4>
Outside Laurier metro.
<p>
When I arrived on Saturday, the bank across the road gave the
temperature as circle. I failed to understand. Now the temperature
is circle, but all is revealed: the time is : .
<p>
And of course this means that my wait in the US consulate is over.
I was too inhibited to write while I was there; the atmosphere of
such a place, reeking of enforced nationalism, upsets me quite
profoundly. The consular official who interviewed me was as nice
as could be, asking me about Cambridge winning the Boat Race and
suggesting that I teach his wife mathematics. But with the next
person after me, a Korean girl whose English was less than
perfect, and who had entered the US on a tourist visa only a few
days before she decided to take a language course, he was fierce
and rude. After this I assumed that his front was just a front and
my application would be turned down, but they've given me three
months multiple entry; he was apologetic that it couldn't be
longer, saying that I should apply in London.
<p>
Out of that place, I felt the need to celebrate in the most
disgusting, debauched way possible -- chocolate and root beer.
<p>
Curiously, while I was waiting in the consulate, I didn't notice
that it is on street level; one could see out of the curtained
windows when the grey light outside was bright enough. I just
hadn't taken that in before.

<h4>1055</h4>
I missed Rick Wilson's talk but am back in time for Noga
Alon's, fortunately. I've just walked into the lecture room to
find a board of Rick's still up, as legible and clear as a
textbook, in beautiful handwriting.
<p>
Sabidussi's problem about focal graphs was this. A graph is focal
if, given any edge <i>e</i>, there is a unique vertex <i>v</i> not in 
<i>e</i> such that any automorphism fixing <i>e</i> fixes <i>v</i>. 
(This is a little different from what Dominic said, which was that any 
non-trivial automorphism fixing e fixes a unique vertex <i>v</i> not in 
<i>e</i>.) Show that deciding whether a graph is focal is equivalent to graph
isomorphism. He pointed out that there are many focal graphs;
e.g., take any bipartite graph, double the vertices on one side
and triple those on the other.

<h4>1448</h4>
Things have begun to slide again. That weird feeling of not
recognizing my surroundings. The feeling is so instantly
identifiable that it makes absolutely no difference whether I'm
in an unfamiliar city. It came at lunch today and again now
during Joe Hemmeter's talk, but it has receded again.
<p>
Last night we went to dinner. Michel was taking us to a Vietnamese
restaurant. When we got there it turned out to be a Danish
restaurant, to our amazement. Some, notably Richard Anstee,
couldn't jut accept the miracle but had to go outside to check
exactly what had happened. (It was simple enough: two doors, and
we had taken the wrong one.)
<p>
Another association scheme session this afternoon, except for
Labelle who is next up.

<h4>1717</h4>
I forgot to mention two squirrels playing outside my room
this morning, making the most wonderful shapes with their tails
and bodies, in space and time, on the ground or on the bottoms
of treetrunks. It may have been a courtship ritual, but it looked
much more like an exuberant game of tig.

<h4>2155</h4>
I ran up the mountain again, including the loop. Despite a
slow start, it was the same as yesterday, or six seconds faster,
to be unnecessarily precise. I was helped by enormous numbers of
runners going up the same way. I passed all of them, none passed
me. My empirical correlation between speed and altitude could have
been given a real test today; I'm sure it would have passed the
test. (Of course, there is a good reason why such a law should be
true.) I was a little surprised that, with such huge numbers out
running, still nobody passed me. Surely someone in this town runs
faster than I do!
<p>
The grey metallic structure I mentioned earlier is actually the
hideous illuminated cross that shines from the top of the mountain
at night. Its orientation shows that my perception of the mountain
top is slightly skewed.
<p>
Afterwards we had the party. I had started thinking about a tiny
point from Ito's talk, that in any set of permutations X, the
average of |fix(<i>x</i><sup>-1</sup><i>y</i>)| is at least 1 with equality 
if and only if the set is uniformly transitive. Michel immediately thought
of some analogous Russian result for the cube, which got me
thinking too. One can show that, in the cube, the Johnson scheme,
and this case (the symmetric group), the average distance between
points of the set is at least some simple function of the space,
with equality if and only if <i>X</i> is the appropriate kind of 1-design.
But for other spaces, one will have to replace "average distance"
by "average of a suitable monotonic function of the distance";
in P- and Q-polynomial association schemes, this function should
be 1-x.y (in the first eigenspace), equivalently the square of
the Euclidean (not spherical) distance from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>.
<p>
So we'll have something to discuss on Saturday.

<h4>1/8/86, 0717</h4>
What we need, in fact, is that, if a scheme is
P- and Q-polynomial and we project into the first eigenspace,
the inner products of the vectors (which depend only on the
distances of the points in the scheme) are a monotone decreasing
function of the distances. This should be true, though I can't
see a proof. (At least, it can't be universally true because, in
a strongly regular graph, both the graph and its complement are
possible, and so the order isn't determined.)

<h4>0813</h4>
I felt wonderful as I stepped out this morning; despite
slight aches in various places, everything seemed in harmony.
Why do I look so old in the photo yesterday?

<h4>1512</h4>
I ran the same route again at lunchtime, after going to the
bank to cash my cheque. It was better and faster than ever before
-- a minute faster than yesterday, the gain fairly uniformly
spread over all parts of the run. It was a warmer day than
yesterday, but not too hot, and no wind; I flew up the last
stretch of the hill and all the way down, despite an incipient
stitch. Still nobody on the mountain to touch me.
<p>
It is not the squirrels or chipmunks in the park that attract
people's attention, but the pigeons!  Several times I've seen
them being pursued by photographers; once, a home video buff was
trying his hardest to make his daughter attractive to a pigeon.
So far as squirrels go, I saw a man lying on the grass putting
food on his stomach, trying to encourage a squirrel to come on
board and get it (without success, at least while I ran past).

<h4>1538</h4> I've missed exactly two talks so far. One was Rick Wilson,
while at the consulate; the other, Avis on repeated distances
between sets of points in Euclidean space, while I was running
today. There are a few other talks that I wouldn't have minded
missing, for example, the present one, on some rather unmotivated
stuff on "chromatic difference sequences" for graphs.
<p>
The answer to the question about P- and Q-polynomial schemes is
no in general. Take such a scheme with more than one P-polynomial
structure, e.g. <i>J</i>(<i>k</i>, 2<i>k</i>+1). The inner products can't be 
monotone functions of the distances in both orderings! It seems, though,
that it is true in many cases.
<p>
It looks as if I will have to do my present shopping tomorrow
morning downtown. We fly out of Mirabel tomorrow afternoon; I
get back on Thursday at lunchtime and would only have an afternoon
at best (barring accidents). If it is done, I can sit in the
airport and work all afternoon.
<p>
It looks, too, as if I'll miss a couple of days' running.
Tomorrow, I think I've earned a holiday. Thursday will also be
quite out of the question. But this week has been so good that
I can't complain in advance about next.
<p>
As to stereotype Chinese who confuse l and r sounds, Zhou
actually says "colorraly", which is interesting in a talk about
colourings!

<h4>1720</h4> 
Conference over. It's pouring with rain, so going to dinner
will have to be deferred for a while. I was so tired that I very
nearly fell asleep during Michel's lecture; the first time that
had happened during the conference, and I don't really understand
why.
<p>
Having missed lunch I am quite hungry, and have a mind to try the
restaurant that Robert and I went to after our eventful trip to
Mt. Tremblant last time I was here. This is failing the accident
of running into someone else on my way out.
<p>
It's fascinating to sit here watching the random flutterings of
leaves hit by raindrops.

<h4>1933</h4> So I put on a tie and went out to the restaurant, the Coin
des C&ocirc;tes. Though the service there is almost too quick, the
food is excellent, much better than the menu might lead you to
expect. I had aubergine in parmesan, sirloin steak, and blueberry
pie, with two bottles of Bras d'Or, and coffee, for twenty dollars,
and had no shadow of complaint about anything I ate. And the
magnificent feeling, sitting there, summoning up good things,
sipping the malt liquor ...
<p>
The Hare Krishna people's argument, that most people look half
dead because they eat corpses, is beneath dismissal as an
intellectual point, though it is a useful reminder. But when on
unfamiliar territory, it must be extremely difficult for a
committed vegetarian to maintain a balanced diet, especially
one capable of sustaining him for fifty-five miles' mountain
running in a week. So I have no regrets at all about my steak,
only gratitude and obligation to the animal concerned. I think
that what upset me more was their dismissal of the point about
killing vegetables. They maintain that eating fruits and seeds
does not involve killing. I would say that the latter, at least,
is no less than murdering the unborn. Of course, I don't stop
eating for that reason. 
<p>
One thing I like about this campus is the extensive use of natural
rock for decoration. It is far prettier than the appalling
buildings that sprout all over the place. I guess that the very
large amount of rock isn't making things any easier for the
diggers of the new metro line, which seems little further advanced
than it was last time I was here. I see that at C&ocirc;te des Neiges
station they have deleted the estimated completion date on the
signboard and written in 1987.
<p>
On the other hand, what makes the place less satisfactory as a
conference venue is the absence of bar and common room facilities.
Sitting alone in one's room from the time lectures end doesn't
make for the sort of atmosphere one expects, where a new theorem
is being hammered out in one corner while less creative effects
of alcohol are being felt in another. 
<p>
I wonder how much mathematics I might have written or done if I
hadn't written so much in this diary. In fact this must be one of
the best documented of all my trips, even though it hasn't been
the most eventful. I was thinking, at dinner, of the events of
the day which brought Robert and me to that same restaurant two
years ago. 

<h4>2040</h4>
The rain eased off as I was walking back from the restaurant,
and the broken high clouds gave promise of a change in the weather.
But it has now set in more steadily. Lights outside reflect in the
wet path, and the leaves are too sodden and heavy to play with the
raindrops any more.
<p>
I've been through my conference paper, and decided to add some
bits and pieces: the clique-coclique bound and the Deza--Frankl
conjecture, sharply edge-transitive groups, d-type, and Delsarte's
theorem motivating the vector transversal designs, which Peter
showed me at lunch yesterday.

<h4>2/8/86, 0800</h4> 
The cafeteria is closed at weekends, and I failed to
discover the existence of anywhere else where you can get anything
to eat. I guess I'll have to look for food down town.
<p>
I slept badly last night -- or rather, well enough when I got to
sleep, which wasn't until after midnight. So I'd got up at various
times, to put on the light to read, jot down a line of music, go
to the toilet. I've now finished the Q stories, and started in on
the (more fantastic, but less supernatural) Peter Carey stories.
He writes very well. 

<h4>0911</h4> 
I'm now sitting on a very upright wooden park bench in front
of fountains of the most secretive kind: solid featureless blocks,
through gaps in which you can glimpse the water playing on
rough-hewn granite-like surfaces inside. Behind them is a monstrous
public building in mock-ch&acirc;teau style, remarkable chiefly for the
brilliance of the verdegris on towers, flashings and drainpipes.
To left and right are huge modern buildings. I haven't yet found
either breakfast or a likely place for present shopping.
<p>
On the street, I saw a huge brown stain where someone had dropped
a bottle of chocolate sauce.

<h4>0947</h4> 
Last time I went to vieux Montr&eacute;al I found a full-scale
tourist-exploiting industry. This time, I have found only urban
decay: a forlorn yard full of fountain statuary (not at all like
the one I just described); a mural with the plaster peeling off,
creating a torn-paper effect with old brickwork underneath, more
beautiful than the original; two butterflies dancing in an empty
parking lot; a man trying to knock down a signpost with a broom
(or was he just trying to break the broom?); huge walls of glass
glimpsed at the end of filthy streets; eroded arches high above
street level crumbling away. But just now I seem to have come to
the tourist trap. This square has some discreet new brickwork, the
flowers are well tended (and shine dazzlingly in the pale
sunshine), and the two vehicles to pass have been a horse-drawn
cart and a police car.
<p>
The one bright spot in my travels earlier was Chinatown, with
triumphal arches and brass plates in the pedestrian street and
well painted cafes. But nothing was open.
<p>
I foresee failure.

<h4>1010</h4> 
Yes, it wasn't at all touristy. Not a sign of a shop of any
description. The buildings were in slightly better repair, and
there were tantalizing glimpses through grilles or down alleyways
into little courtyards, but it certainly doesn't serve the
function it did last time. It bothers me, too, that things are so
shut. Don't people here go to town on a Saturday? I've actually,
at last, found a cafe open for breakfast, and am filling one need.
After that, I have no choice but to make for one of the big
underground shopping centres to see if something is open there.
<p>
Another surprising thing is the absence of maps, guides, or other
public information. The only two such plaques I recall seeing are
the one at the cafe on Mt. Royal describing Cartier's early visit,
and one on the railings of a cemetery commemorating the first
historian of Canada in the French language. (And that one didn't
even say why it was where it was, but somehow gave the impression
that that was irrelevant.) 

<h4>2358</h4>
Just squeezing in a report of the rest of today, nominally!
It hasn't been a good day.
<p>
I went to Place Bonaventure and found the shops open, even
uncrowded -- virtually deserted, in fact -- but wasn't able to
find much in the way of presents for the kids there. Apart from
low-grade fashion shops, and one eskimo carving shop with pieces
a bit out of my range, there was really very little, so I gave up
in disgust and went back to the University. 
<p>
I found Michel there waiting. We agreed to set off for the airport
straight away, and I let him talk me into taking a taxi. Once
there, he insisted in going round every shop in the terminal. I
would have preferred saving them up for the way back. After my
experience this morning, I've no great desire to spend my last
few hours on Canadian soil in downtown Montr&eacute;al. We had a quick
lunch and then went through security check, to find ... yes ...
yet more shops.
<p>
But also to find an hour and a quarter's delay to our flight. And
that was as nothing. People Express has a lot to do to convince
me they are not a bunch of hopeless incompetents. At Newark, we
had to change terminals, and they promised us a bus in five
minutes. It took them half an hour to figure out that they'd lost
their bus, and then some time to commandeer one from the New
Jersey Transit Authority. We found the other terminal jammed with
people, so that it was almost impossible to get to our gate. When
we got there, they tried for another hour and a quarter to
persuade us that our flight was about to board. The problem, it
transpired, was that the crew who were supposed to fly us to
Columbus were somewhere over our heads in a holding pattern.
We've just taken off, more than an hour and a half late, and I
dread to think what will await us in Columbus at something after
1am in the morning.
<p>
What bothered me far more than the inefficient organisation was
the fact that nobody knew what was happening, and in the absence
of confirmation, they were quite ready with lies to stop us from
stampeding. There were four flights supposed to be leaving from
our gate, which was not a gate in the usual airport sense, much
more like a gate in a bus station. (Indeed the whole enterprise
was reminiscent of a seedy bus company.) The first of these was
due out to Buffalo at 8pm. One very angry man had been waiting for
this flight since then (we arrived about 10pm) and had just
discovered that another flight to Buffalo had left, unannounced,
from a different gate at 9.30pm. The ground staff refused even
to offer him an apology, and the other passengers soon turned
against him, apparently believing mistakenly that if he'd shut up
and go away the ground staff could expedite their own departures.
<p>
In our case, too, there was the oft-repeated bland assurance that
boarding would be "in ten to fifteen minutes", or "momentarily".
<p>
The other thing that disturbed me was a smiling photo of Ronald
Reagan, with some bland saccharin message, hanging over the
entrance to immigration control for non-U.S. citizens in Newark.
Presumably anyone reacting adversely to his portrait can be
excluded from the country.
<p>
The one profitable thing from the journey was an example for
Michel of a paratransversal design. Essentially, what he requires
is a group with two families of subgroups with the properties that
subgroups from different families are complementary, and the
union of all the subgroups is <i>G</i>. This holds if <i>G</i> is 
<i>D</i><sub>8</sub>&nbsp;circ&nbsp;<i>D</i><sub>8</sub>,
one family consisting of the <i>V</i><sub>4</sub>s not containing the centre, 
the other consisting of the <i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>s. This generalizes a trivial 
example in <i>D</i><sub>8</sub>, but the sequence stops there.

<h4>3/8/86, 0904</h4>
I don't think I mentioned that part of the reason for
the chaos last night was a storm over Newark -- at least, that's
all that People Express would admit to.
<p>
One more instance of their failings awaited us. On arrival in
Columbus, we found Navin Singhi wasn't there. It turned out he'd
been told by People Express that our flight hadn't left yet!
Michel phoned him, and he came out promptly to pick us up. There
is a bed and a sofa; we tossed, I got the sofa, and that's all I
remember until now.

<h4>4/8/86, 0727</h4> 
And that was the only free moment, apart from a run.
<p>
We got up, had tea (with hot milk), then later the most marvellous
breakfast (spicy vegetable sandwiches, fruit and gulab jamen).
Soon afterwards I ran, suspecting that no further time would be
free. It was already a very hot day. I found on the map that
there was a little river not too far away (I guessed 3 miles but
I'm sure it was closer to 4) down a straight road, and set out to
run there. The straight road, just an ordinary suburban crosstown
street, had six lanes and about three times the traffic density of
the Oxford ring road. (Where were they all going, on a Sunday
morning? Not to church; I passed a church, totally deserted.
Some were going shopping, in the huge shopping areas ribboning
the road.) Also, it was without a footpath, so I had to run on
the edge of the mayhem. With this, the heat (already blazing sun
at 11.30), and the general unfamiliarity, to say nothing of
tiredness in my legs from all the standing the day before, of
course I didn't run terribly well. But it was 50 minutes, and not
disastrous.
<p>
Came back dripping with sweat, and had a shower, which didn't
really stop the dripping. Then Michel and Navin and I went out
to spend the day in the local Wendy, pretending that it was a
Paris or Tokyo coffeehouse. I must say it served the purpose
remarkably well. We stayed there until about 8pm, during which
time we drank huge quantities of tea and coffee, ate cookies and
salads, and talked a lot of mathematics. We talked around various
things, and finally settled on sharp sets and groups of type
{0,2} on infinite sets. We decided that a free construction would
almost certainly give such a thing -- Navin wanted to know the
connection with free planes and free algebraic objects, I didn't
care so much about this -- and, much to my surprise, showed that
no groups could exist. (Perhaps not so surprising, as I'd been
turning the problem over in my mind for a few days, lubricating
the connections.) Then, after discussing religion for a while,
we went home to a dinner even more delicious than breakfast:
vegetable curry, spicy cauliflower, some non-spicy dishes (for
Michel) including peas and carrots in a kind of custard, beautiful
chapatis, chopped melon, yoghurt. After dinner, we looked at
Michel and Navin's "ternary projective planes", {0,1,-1} matrices
<i>A</i> satisfying <i>AA</i><sup>T</sup>=<i>nI</i>+<i>J</i>. We started out 
trying to prove that they had a certain structure, and ended out with an 
enormously flexible construction for weighing matrices which gives many new 
ternary planes as a by-product. Michel says that weighing matrices are an
Australian preoccupation -- I guess that Jenny Seberry has written
a book, or something -- and that the construction will be food for
generations of Australian research students to cut their milk
teeth on!
<p>
We got to bed well after midnight, and that was the day. Except
that many things are inevitably left out of such an account, such
as playing with the twins, who are entirely different but
enormously appealing -- the old experience of dividing myself
between thinking about mathematics and attending to the demands
of a child (among their limited English has appeared the word
"uncle"); the singing of crickets in the trees across the parking
lot; broad swathes of light reflected in the lake cut by
mysterious shadows of tree trunks; the unexpected sight of
Concorde flying over the town low, slow and noisy; failure to get
even the slightest glimpse of the town centre, which I remember as
a tiny cluster of tall buildings sprouting from dead flat plain
without any foothills; the odd feeling of mixed cultures as we
worked and the sunlight moved slanting across the cafe where
people came for fast food to go and went (and I mean the clash
between mathematicians and others -- we three, Russian, Indian
and Australian, were quite in tune); and so on.

<h4>2357</h4>
Another magnificent breakfast. Then a student drove us into
town. Dijen Ray-Chaudhuri and Eiichi were there, and organized a
letter from the Chairman giving me entree to the athletic
facilities to shower after my run.
<p>
By this time it was early lunchtime; despite the late breakfast,
I went to lunch with Dijen, Eiichi and Tatsuro. We met Tom Dowling
there. I had just a salad. I seem to have become entirely
vegetarian at the moment. I certainly feel well on it. I think I
should cultivate listening to my body a little more. Slight
problem with wind, which I associate rather with travelling than
with diet.
<p>
After lunch I spent a while with Eiichi. He told me some
interesting things. There is one known family of simple
non-associative Moufang loops, parametrised by fields GF(<i>q</i>),
order <i>q</i><sup>3</sup>(<i>q</i><sup>4</sup>-1)/(2,<i>q</i>) (he said -- 
I wonder if that denominator should be (2,<i>q</i>-1)). He claimed that its 
multiplication group is <i>D</i><sub>4</sub>(<i>q</i>) on the cosets of 
<i>C</i>(sigma)&lt;sigma&gt;, where sigma is a graph
automorphism of order 2. He also claimed that it has the same
number of conjugacy classes as PSL(2,<i>q</i><sup>3</sup>) (at least for 
<i>q</i> even), and conjectures the same character table. Remarkable: 
PSL(2,<i>q</i><sup>3</sup>) does not even appear to be a subgroup of 
<i>D</i><sub>4</sub>(<i>q</i>), let alone a
regular subgroup of the permutation representation.
<p>
Also, a construction of distance-regular digraphs of girth 4 by
Liebler and Mena (infinitely many, following an example by
Enomoto and Mena). Also, a characterisation of the bilinear forms
graph by its parameters and a weak form of the 4-vertex condition.
<p>
I went running after that. Things were not quite as smooth as
planned. They let me into the gymnasium, but padlocks for lockers
were a problem. There are some red ones kept for some reason by
the attendants. They lent me one but made it clear that they
wouldn't do this again tomorrow, with a strong suggestion (which
turned out true in the end) that all else they would do was to
come and take it off and remove it when I'd finished. This led
to a problem about getting my towel and soap out to shower with
after the run. In the end, I chanced leaving them on top of the
lockers with clothes and valuables inside.
<p>
I lost my way going to West Campus, so ran by the river instead.
I had to retrace my steps several times, because the path didn't
go close to the river, or went somewhere else, or led to a busy
road, or ceased to exist. But it was more enjoyable than yesterday.
I ran for 43 minutes, counting time spent being lost. It was still
very hot.
<p>
Then home, for another wonderful dinner, and out again to what
I've come to call the Wendy House. This was less productive.
Michel was pushing his ternary planes, which have gone as far as
they are going. We did a little on infinite geometric groups,
which is going somewhere, but only as far as the lemma that if <i>G</i>
is 2-transitive and <i>G<sub>ab</sub></i> is of finite even order then
some involution in <i>G</i> fixes infinitely many points. This
substantially shortens both cases in our earlier proof (as well
as avoiding a point I'd been worried about), and will almost
certainly do more, probably {0,<i>l</i>} for <i>l</i> congruent to 2
mod 4.
<p>
After a long day I'm ready for bed.

<h4>6/8/86, 0659</h4>
No time for the coffee house yesterday. I had
intended to run in the morning, but was too lazy in the event,
just sat eating breakfast instead. Then we went in to the
University, and Michel propogandized me on the subject of
paratransversal systems, with some effect -- I did the
calculations for the example consisting of some lines of an
affine plane. Also I found an 8&times;8 weighing design with a
partition not arising from our earlier construction, so
destroying our characterization of "ternary projective planes"
of order 4.
<p>
We worked so hard that we forgot about lunch until after 1.30. We
walked across the square looking for somewhere to eat but without
success. There was no time for anything too elaborate because
Michel was talking at 2.
<p>
It was interesting stuff, attempting to characterize embeddability
of finite metric spaces in l^2 by "hypermetric" inequalities. Far
too much material for an hour, though, and it didn't help that the
projector didn't come until half-way through.
<p>
I followed on with sum-free sets. It went OK. Several group
theorists came. I don't know whether they went away disappointed.
But I enjoyed myself, even though it didn't have quite the impact
it should have.
<p>
After that, some farewell words from Michel, then off to dinner
with Bannai and Ito at a Japanese restaurant. Sushi on a large bed
of rice, then shabu-shabu on another large bed of rice. Very good,
enormously filling. Lovely calm relaxing surroundings, with the
attention of a beautiful Japanese waitress to explain the
technique of cooking the shabu-shabu; we talked little about
mathematics, some about this and that, and I felt very calm.
<p>
We spun out our time at the restaurant until 8 with cups of tea
and then went to Bannai's house, where he played with his baby
and his wife served us with a delicious red bean confection and
pieces of melon (which the baby loved).
<p>
At about 9.30 he brought me back here.
<p>
Nikhil and Nidhi were eagerly awaiting me and delighted to see
me -- they had been asking whether uncle had got lost! They sat
on my knee for Navin to take photos, and then we looked at their
photo album where they delighted in identifying themselves, poppa
and mummy in all the pictures, together with various other
highlights of their life here such as the clown who gave away
balloons at the shopping centre.
<p>
Then we worked for a while. We cracked geometric groups of type
{0,<i>m</i>} for <i>m</i> even, and feel ourselves close to SETGs of this form.
I wonder too whether type {0,<i>m</i>,2<i>m</i>}, when 3 divides <i>m</i>, is 
now within reach.
<p>
To bed about midnight -- I slept on the problem but without
success.

<h4>1308</h4>
Yes, we've killed {0,<i>m</i>,2<i>m</i>} with the same argument.
Furthermore we checked the free construction and it seems to work.
<p>
I'm now sitting in Victor Klee's lecture to the summer school.
Among other things, he says that Kenneth May searched the
literature and refuted the assertion that "mediaeval cartographers
knew that four colours suffice" as effectively as such an
assertion can be refuted.
<p>
He has now turned to the chromatic number of the unit distance
graph in the Euclidean plane, showing that 4&lt;=<i>c</i>&lt;=7. He also
discusses the idea of a "safe" colouring, so it doesn't matter if
you slop the plane a bit, and the 7-colouring of the plane is safe.
(On the line there is a 2-colouring, but the best known safe
colouring has three colours.)
<p>
This morning I woke up at about 6.30 but, after writing the above,
dozed off again until 8.15. How noble: I got up and went out
running. It wasn't very good. I almost turned straight round and
went back again. My ankles were so rigid I could only shuffle along.
It went a little bit better after a while, but it was clear that
my metabolism was so slow that a long hard run wouldn't be a good
idea. So when I came to the deaf school, I ran around the grounds
(slowly, on the uneven grassy surface), and turned around and went
back. A freight train went over the bridge, taking two minutes and
40 seconds to go by. It appeared to be doing a good 30 miles per
hour, so over a mile long; a very small train, by the standards
applicable here, I think! I got back in 37 minutes.
<p>
Although I had a shower, it was so humid already that I went on
sweating for a long time and had to change after breakfast.
Michel having gone, breakfast became spicier: chick peas with
lots of chillis, orange juice, fruit and milky dessert.
<p>
After breakfast, and after Navin had taken the children to school,
we came in to the University. We worked some more on the free
constructions -- I keep having crises of conscience about whether
it works at all, or whether it gives examples for
{0,<i>m</i>,2<i>m</i>,...,(<i>t</i>-1)<i>m</i>}, 
{0,1,3,...,2<sup><i>d</i></sup>-1}, and
{0,1,<i>q</i>,...,<i>q<sup>d</sup></i>}. 
I never believe a free construction unless I can write it out carefully.
<p>
Victor Klee asks what is the maximum number of lines in Euclidean
3-space, any two at distance 1. Is it 7? What about other kinds of
flats in other dimensions?

<h4>2244</h4> 
After the lecture I went back to Navin's room. We decided it
was time to bite the bullet and get on with the business of
developing an extension theory for association schemes. We worked
on it for an hour, went home and ate lunch, went to the Wendy
house, and worked on it again until 8pm, with only the slightest
glimmer of a breakthrough. It is difficult to know what to do
about this problem. But we do at least have a number to calculate.
<p>
Then we went home, played with the children, ate dinner -- a
deliciously spiced dahl, cabbage, raita, rice and pickle -- then
talked more mathematics. By this time we had finally managed to
leave the question of extensions of schemes alone, but we ranged
over many things, some inspired by my notes of the Montr&eacute;al
conference. I'm going to bed  now; I've set my alarm for 5 o'clock
in the morning.
<p>
Just before bedtime, Navin's wife came in with presents: a
beautiful embroidered Indian dress from Lucknow for Sheila, and
another dress for Hester.

<h4>7/8/86, 0550</h4>
The beginning of the way back, which means, I
suppose, that I'll feel temporary for more than 24 hours, until
I arrive back home.
<p>
I set my alarm for 5.00 but woke up at 4.55. (Would I have woken
up but for Navin going to the bathroom at that moment?) I woke
feeling tired and without conviction that now was the moment; I
had woken once previously at about 12.50, and got up to go to
the window where there was just enough light to see the time.
<p>
I dressed and packed my pyjamas while Navin made tea. I've done
very little in the way of checking that nothing has been left
behind; but I have my passport, wallet, BA ticket, and PE
reservation number -- the essentials, I suppose.
<p>
I left the Inuit art calendar as a gift, then we set out for the
airport. Who could fail to feel some excitement at starting a
journey at that hour? We drove through near-deserted streets, past
empty donut houses, and along a tiny country road, where the
feeling suddenly overwhelmed me that the assumptions I'd made
were wrong; I was  travelling along an endless road in the middle
of nowhere.
<p>
But we arrived at the airport, ten minutes before the PE desk was
staffed. 

<h4>0611</h4> 
Now through check-in and airport security and sitting in the
PE lounge waiting, as I will be spending a lot of time doing. I
checked my suitcase, a change of procedure for me; another change
is having a window seat well forward of the wing and the chance
to cloudwatch.
<p>
Impressions of America:
<ul>
<li>
Two strangers on the flight here discussing their divorces and
other personal problems.
<li>
Navin instinctively heading for the car to drive round the
corner to the cafe. (The same thought struck us both at the
same time, so we walked.)
</ul>
More important impressions are of Navin and his family. He's such
a gentle person that I seem violent by comparison, and yet I
feel quite at ease in his company. We can sit quietly without any
strain, but it comes more naturally to us to talk about
mathematics. And to find somebody with whom I work so well, think
so well, is a rare experience. And the goodwill of all four of
them overwhelmed me. Nidhi and Nikhil came out at bedtime to
say, "Uncle, come back soon", and to wish me "Namas-te" in
traditional manner. They'll have photos of me in their album,
so perhaps they will remember me. How fortunate that I came to
Columbus!
<p>
Navin and Michel were interesting to watch together. Apart from
Marie, I haven't seen anyone so positively accepting and loving
towards Michel; most people don't find him very easy to accept
or love. But they are very important to each other, I think.
<p>
It rained last night while we were at Wendy's, though that hasn't
eased the heat much. It is a little cooler this morning, but still
humid, and the light cloud will be no protection against the sun.
Light is stealing in; it seems earlier than the clocks allow, but
we are very near the western edge of the time zone here; in
Indiana it is an hour earlier. Against the touch of pink, the
clouds are slate-coloured. I can't see our plane; either it is at
the end of the building, or we are going to be late.
I have an hour and three quarters for the connection at Newark.
<p>
Talking of Indiana: a glimpse of a signpost to Wheeling and
Indianapolis (via the east-west highway crossing the north-south
highway just north of Columbus) brought back memories of my
cross-country trip in 1973. I stopped in Columbus then in the
hours of darkness and saw only the inside of the bus station, as
I recall.
<p>
A plane now exists. It has to be pulled up at some distance from 
the gate, but having to walk to the plane is the sort of thing I
don't mind at all if it makes for cheaper fares.
<p>
This morning before we left, Navin tried out an argument which 
should extend our result on infinite geometric groups to SETGs. 
It's not quite right as it stands, but I have high hopes. He'll 
probably have done it before I get home. This piece alone has made 
the trip to Columbus profitable for me, but of course it's not
the real reason!
<p>
This terminal is somewhere between an airport and a bus station
(unlike Newark, which was nothing but a bus station). At the
adjacent gate, almost all the passengers have bleached hair -- 
yet it's not a Florida Express flight. Our plane has now begun
flashing lights; the noise level is rising; the barrier has been
drawn back; we'll be boarding soon, I guess. Perhaps I'll sleep
on the plane. But there may be a delay. The man behind the desk
can't get his microphone to work, and he seems reluctant to raise
his voice. Would they delay the flight for that reason?

<h4>0701</h4> 
Correction, it was Florida Express. And he did shout, or
rather, raise his voice just slightly.
<p>
Light came in quickly and unobtrusively. The sun rose red and
ineffectual behind the grey haze, but as it ascended through
the haze it painted gold the torn clouds above, so that the
light came in two layers, pink and yellow. Very soon it won't
be dawn any more, but full day.
<p>
The thought crossed my mind of going for a run at Mirabel. But
lack of changing facilities and safe keeping for my baggage deterred
me, and in the end I packed away my running gear with my checked
baggage.
<p>
Perhaps what this diary proves is that writing a book would not
be too hard, if I could submit to the discipline of writing a little
every day. (I think that writing at regular times would be too great
a shock to my system.)

<h4>0739</h4> 
Still sitting on the tarmac. They can't start the engines.
The engines have to be started by an air-operated machine hooked on
by a big hose. Their machine wouldn't work, and they had to borrow
another, which has just arrived; with what result, I don't yet know,
though one of the men walking round outside without earmuffs had his
fingers in his ears (a good sign).
<p>
No, this machine doesn't work either, so there will be a delay of
"several minutes". They are opening the doors for fresh air because,
without engines, there's no air-conditioning.

<h4>0758</h4> 
Moving at last. PE compensated us for the delay with free orange
juice. Starting an hour late, I should hopefully still make my
connection in Newark. But who knows what might still happen?

<h4>0806</h4> 
Well, this is it. One of the engines has stopped and has to be
re-started. I can't help feeling just a little bit nervous. On the
way up here, a shudder suddenly possessed me. And I've finished
reading the in-flight magazine. Nothing to do but mathematics.
<p>
Weak sun spotlights the terminal buildings across wide expanses
of flat space, in front of a rapidly advancing cloud bank from the
west. There is an Eastern Airlines plane behind us; I wonder if
perhaps it is not allowed, by regulation, to overtake. (According
to the pilot, we are not allowed to use one engine to start the other.
I wonder if that applies in flight.)
<p>
Now totally overcast, and the darkened terminal building has receded
into the murk.

<h4>0827</h4> 
Eastern went past and took off. From this end-on angle, it
seemed almost like a vertical take-off with rocket propulsion. After
that, two small planes, American also, went past and away, and now
US Air; but at least we have engines on. And, at that moment, fresh
air, and a promise from the Captain of departure in five minutes.
<p>
Cloud is even heavier now, but small sun windows are coming over.
One is passing us now, the light striking across the glasses of
passengers across the aisle, making little glowing patches of bright
colour.
<p>
The disorientation I've had lately has no relationship to the
familiarity of my surroundings. I know the symptoms; I know without
looking up that when I do look up things will be strange. The symptoms
in the Math Department in Columbus are identical to those in Merton.
It is a non-recognition which isn't intellectual, more a removal of
the veil, a reminder of what is really out there.
<p>
US Air is away and, believe it or not, we're moving out onto the runway.

<h4>0846</h4> 
We were very quickly past the flag-adorned terminal and above
the cloud layer, and now we're in dazzling sun between white and blue,
with three tiny black shapes like ominous battleships on the horizon.
Now we've  just crossed a front onto a higher and more jumbled cloud
layer; through a gap in the wall, the mysterious bronze colour of
sunlight reflected from a lake below shows through.
<p>
The horizon is not the least remarkable thing. The smooth white of
the lower layer darkens to grey, then there is a gold stripe across
the grey, then a thick layer of even brighter white, surmounted by
a yellowish-brown streak with the tiny black mounds in front of it.
Then comes the blue sky, rapidly darkening above.

<h4>0903</h4> 
We're now ticketed and fed, and less than an hour out of Newark
(I hope).
<p>
Those ominous battleships were just the distant signs of the most
incredible cloud wall, made of twisted shapes tumbled and leaning
at crazy angles, rising from the plateau so as almost to touch our
underbelly, and to shake us with their turbulence. It was very difficult
to see them as insubstantial; they were as solid as rocks on a
mountainside. (The true lesson, though, is the other way.) They were
mountains by the shore, the sea in this case being land, now visible
through a light haze below.
<p>
According to the (very rough) map in the in-flight magazine, Columbus to
Newark is slightly north of east, and we should be past Pittsburgh now,
and crossing the Appalachians. And indeed the geometric farms gave way to
forest just as another cloud plain screened the land from our view again
and we hit another pocket of turbulence.

<h4>0919</h4> 
Now we could almost be over the sea. The clouds are wispy white
calligraphy over a hazy blue, through which it is possible to discern
details of the landscape if you look hard; it's like flying over Atlantis.
The blue sky is quite a different colour, much harder and more aggressive.
The main change, though, is an overhead cloud canopy. It's just overhead,
almost possible to touch, and the sky is bounded by its edge. We are
looking out from under a shelter.
<p>
We just passed a contrail, crossing our path, just above us and below the
cloud canopy, like a streamer hung from the ceiling. As we crossed right
underneath it I could look along its length and think that somebody went
that way.

<h4>1011</h4> 
We approached Newark over an expanse of forest, with slow,
meandering rivers. (The pine barrens? I don't know.) The suburban
houses bordering the forest were set right in the green carpet; every
other one had a turquoise swimming pool. (Deeper into the built-up area,
there were even more pools.) A car wrecker's yard and a container
terminal added bright colours as we came in.
<p>
On the approach run, I got an idea which should fix Navin's argument about
SETGs. If I can recover it, I'll write it out on this leg and try to mail
it to him from Mirabel.
<p>
At Newark, we came in, fortunately, almost opposite the gate from which
the Montr&eacute;al flight was due to leave. I boarded and found open seating
with very few empty seats, so I took the first one free, an aisle seat
in row 2. No cloudwatching on this leg. And indeed, the euphoria has
evaporated in the face of customs declarations etc., mainly I guess just
the thought of crossing frontiers.
<p>
We're now moving away, my first PE flight so far to leave within spitting
distance of the advertised time. I just wonder if they got my suitcase on
board! It's easy to invent any number of difficult problems (as Gauss is
supposed to have said about Fermat's last theorem.)
<p>
On this flight they don't even wait for us to be airborne before commencing
the ticketing procedure. Such optimism!

<h4>1109</h4> 
Hah! It was actually 10.45 by the time we left; there was a long queue
for take-off. Still, that's better than their previous record by some way.
<p>
Also, my argument collapsed in ruins.

<h4>1245</h4> 
But, after all that, we came in to land within a minute of the
advertised arrival time.
<p>
Then the unexpected. In the people-moving device to the terminal, I found
myself sitting next to Jeff Kahn and Ayerung Moon, who happen to be married
to each other, and who also just happened to be flying from Newark (their
local airport) to Montr&eacute;al. Jeff knew that I was in Montr&eacute;al 
last week, having in the meantime talked to someone who'd been at the 
conference, but didn't expect to see me flying into Montr&eacute;al. We talked 
about mathematics of course; he told me the following problem: Let <i>G</i> be
a graph on <i>n</i> vertices with small valency <i>k</i> (such as 
<i>c</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i> or <i>n</i><sup>epsilon</sup>). 
Probabilistically one expects a small set of size o(<i>n</i>) to
have induced subgraph of valency o(<i>k</i>). Problem: Find explicit examples!
I told him a few things about the random graph. We had a very pleasant time
until past immigration, when they disappeared to take the bus downtown.
<p>
I walked the length of the terminal building from arrivals to departures.
The British Airways desk is next door to People Express at the very far end.
Of course there was nobody in sight. So I walked back down the terminal
building to the left-luggage office. It was closed. There was a number to
call for service. I dialled it. The phone made three different sorts of
noises at me, one the ringing tone, one very loud and unpleasant. I hung
up and took my bags away. I went upstairs, found a bathroom, shaved and
brushed my teeth, went to the cafeteria for lunch.
<p>
I'm now sitting at a table, finishing a donut. It's raining non-trivially
outside, which gives me even less incentive to go downtown. It is
interesting, though, being a tourist in this airport building. It isn't
crowded; the facilities are pleasant enough; there are enough tourist
traps, a bookshop, a post office (which might be open now). I'm sitting
at the edge of the upper level, watching kids below me playing with the
automatic doors and grey clouds raining on grey concrete behind the glass.
<p>
The man next to me on the last flight was full of suppressed anger. He
filled in his wife's customs declaration because she was being too slow;
and he became annoyed momentarily (in the English sense) when he
discovered he'd spilt Coke on his trousers.
<p>
I'll go shopping now, then I'll take coffee and try to write out the free
construction.

<h4>1341</h4> 
I got my suitcase checked in OK this time. I only hope there is
someone there to take it out again when I leave!
<p>
I've bought a postcard and written to Navin, confessing failure to put
right the gap. On the other side is a Canadian raccoon. I also bought a
couple of books. But the better shopping is on the other side of airport
security, to which I won't have access until British Airways begin
checking-in procedures.

<h4>1501</h4> 
At least the free construction of sharp sets seems to work OK in all
cases. I wrote Michel a postcard to tell him. I also weakened and did some
shopping -- kids' junk and maple syrup.
<p>
The rain seems to have stopped, but fog is closing in. The road out of the
airport, seen from the end of the terminal building just beyond the chapel,
disappears completely from sight as it passes through a stand of trees. I
overheard some people awaiting arrivals, discussing the lateness of the
flights. I suppose it will be possible to leave more or less on time
despite the fog (if, that is, the aeroplane isn't delayed on its way here
from somewhere else).
<p>
I feel as if I'm re-entering life after a spell in a monastery. I felt
guilty eating a corned beef sandwich and drinking a beer with my lunch.

<h4>1626</h4> 
A little French-Canadian Jesuit priest came and moved me on so he
could celebrate Mass. He didn't mean to be offensive; he was very earnest
and explained how the English treated him better than the French, and he'd
been to Windsor Castle, and so on. It was just that the combination of his
brusque manner and his first words to me had been a bit forbidding. So,
after helping him to shift the seat I'd been sitting on, I decamped, and
he lost the chance to save a soul (some chance!).
<p>
So I went and had coffee, then went up the other end and did a few exercises
in a reasonably secluded spot, overlooking a wide tarmac. The view is green
and grey and most shades between.
<p>
I bought an American running magazine. The standard of journalism is
extremely high, though the style is definitely American and dogmatic. The
pictures accompanying the article about Said Aouita, too, would grace a
travel magazine. His career sounds quite incredible (and is peppered with
guarded expressions of disbelief from the journalist and various quoted
authorities, particularly concerning a training session of 5 x 800
with half-minute recoveries in an average time of 1.47, with the
last being the fastest!)
<p>
On running: my heels are giving me some concern now. They feel OK until I
start running, but then they just lack spring or bounce or even
flexibility, so that I move in a very flat way until they've warmed up
enough to bend. It's not really a question of pain, just this immobility.

<h4>1646</h4> 
Guess what? They've just announced that the People Express flight
will be delayed, due to the late arrival of the incoming service.

<h4>1951</h4> 
Airports rattle me. In the duty free shop, they wouldn't sell me
souvenirs at the main checkout, so I went to the souvenir center and got
enmeshed in a big group of Italians who obviously thought Canadian dollars
were going out of fashion. The woman at the checkout, hassled and unable to
cope, told me to go to the main checkout. I declined.
<p>
Then, at the coffee bar, a man glared at me when I sat at his table. (It
was the only table with fewer than two people at it.) Then a poisonous
cloud of nicotine and tar came drifting over from a woman just behind me,
so I moved. This was too much for him; he ordered me off the chair on
which his wife had been sitting.
<p>
The airport, so dead during the day, comes alive in the evening, with all
the European traffic. Naturally, there is a progression: the Russians
leave first, the Yugoslavs next, and the British are the close of the
evening's entertainment.
<p>
Still no luck with the SETGs. My brain is tiring. Of course, giving up and
reading won't help.
<p>
An hour and a quarter until boarding.

<h4>2018</h4> 
The name of Tarthang Tulku has come up twice today. I saw his book
in the bookshop (in French, so I didn't buy it), and then on page 15 of
LaBerge's Lucid Dreaming is a quote from him: "Dreams are a reservoir
of knowledge and experience, yet they are often overlooked as a vehicle for
exploring reality", quoted from a book of his called Openness  Mind.
<p>
Why?
<p>
I await a third encounter. In the case of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, the
third was finding her book in a shop, after being told about her by
Liz Billington and then reading a magazine article.

<h4>2221</h4>
Airborne. And with the minimum of fuss.

<h4>8/8/86, 0716 (BST)</h4> 
And after a few hours' sleep and a drink of water, what
more could I want?
<p>
Congratulations (almost) to BA for one of the best airline meals I've had,
last night. After the sausage and cheese starter, there was a dish of
chicken and kumquats on saffron rice, which was very tasty but spoilt by
having been kept hot so long that it had dried out; then melon and
strawberries, real fruit with real taste, served up on a real leaf of
some sort. I was so tired I dozed off before it came and went very
soundly asleep afterwards.
<p>
The film is exceptionally long, having been going since the end of dinner
(which must be nearly three hours ago). I don't know what it is, though.

<h4>0744</h4> 
A terrible thought just occurred to me. What if I didn't really wake
up at 5 yesterday but just dreamed that I did? If so, and if I'm still
dreaming, then either I've missed my flight, or I'll have to go through
all this again!

<h4>0757</h4> 
Full daylight, film over. Out of the window, blue sea with little
pieces of cotton wool, pale horizon with grey band, and totally clear
blue sky. Sunlight falling on the plane's wing, but I can't determine
in which direction the shadow should lie.
<p>
For a moment I mis-cued and imagined us flying west. We must, in fact, be
going some way south of the morning sun; the shadow is only some fifteen
feet out on the wing. I guess the antisolar point is so far round behind
us that it's impossible to see it from this window.
<p>
As I was dropping off to sleep, I was awakened  several times by clamorous
but unintelligible voices. This is what LaBerge calls the hypnagogic state.

<h4>0833</h4> 
The land crept in unobtrusively -- a cape, a round bay, a river --
and took the place of the sea. On the other side of Ireland, we had sea 
again, but now we've just crossed the coast of Wales. Despite cloud cover,
thick in places, there have been many windows. The only problem is that I
have to crane my neck so to get any glimpse of the view. It's easier to
stick with the interior landscape of my book.
<p>
Breakfast has come and gone too, and we should be down on the ground in
half an hour.

<h4>0900</h4> 
The approach to Heathrow is spectacular. It's clearer than I've ever
seen it in England, with occasional little round clouds, and when the plane
banks to turn (right, fortunately), the whole landscape of England looms
over us. Following us on this merry-go-round is another plane: we are as
if on the ends of an axis, though sometimes it seems less mechanical than
that, a fish swimming through this aquatic world.
<p>
I suppose that this stacking will delay us. But I don't mind very much.

<h4>1100</h4> 
There seems to be a need to close the account.
<p>
After landing we taxied for about ten minutes and still had a long bus ride
to the terminal. The in-flight magazine raved about T4 which, it said, has
dispensed with corridors -- but I'd much rather walk down a corridor than
that!
<p>
At the bus stop, some hike from the terminal, were a couple from Vermont
going to Oxford where their son is graduating.
<p>
We're passing High Wycombe; I've finished the dream book; and this bus is
too bumpy to write more.

<h4>1116</h4> 
One more thing, too good to omit. On a sign warning of roadworks:
"Possible delays until December".
