19 March

A busy day at work: lecture, office hour with lots of customers (one of whom
left some lecture notes in my office), class, TLC meeting (at which Leonard
got very angry about the proposed policy on teaching materials), Michael
and Irene, then Bill talking in the CSG about his new zero-free interval
for chromatic polynomials of 3-connected planar graphs. We had a drink
at which I got a bit of feedback about the result of the external review
(Oscar said that Thomas said that the Principal said at academic board
that it had been very successful).

Then home to pack. I have to make an early start in the morning because the
Piccadilly line is not running: I have to go to Ealing Broadway and catch
a bus to Boston Manor.
