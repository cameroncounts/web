<h4>11/12/88, 1214</h4>

I set out on this trip with less joy than usual. Mainly
this is because of the flu which hasn't left me, the ache
in my head, throat, shoulders and back. Travelling is an ordeal,
especially across time zones. I know quite little about where
I'm going and what will happen; I can't believe it will be like
going to Canada or even Germany. And finally, Hester's tearful
farewell. She was more openly grieving than one expects in prospect
of a 2 1/2-week separation, even if it includes her birthday and
Christmas.
<p>
I slept badly, but at least wasn't jolted out of deep slumber
by the infernal alarm. Hester and Neill got up to see me off,
after a brief breakfast. Waiting in the cold dark for the bus
was not pleasant. When it came, I tried to curl up on it and
sleep; first I was uncomfortable, and then when I relaxed I
felt not strong enough to cope with an airport. I took the
precaution of rousing myself well before Gatwick.
<p>
The airport: outside, geometric patterns of light (in the 
multi-storey car parks on arrival, and on the runways on 
departure); inside, much nicer shops than Heathrow, and room 
on the seats to stretch out for a bit.
<p>
We took off through a blanket of cloud, which later cleared to 
give us good views of the Alps. After than I didn't look out of 
the window much until after lunch, when I started writing this; 
we were passing over the Strait of Messina and the toe of Italy,
if my guess is right (confirmed in part by some little conical
islands which are marked on the map). Now the Ionian sea is covered
with small broken clouds. I'm sitting right by the sunny side window
--- no posh travel for me --- and have quite a good view forward
over the wing, but don't feel strong enough to take advantage of it.
<p>
Flight time is 6.45 to Dhahran and another 1.25 to Muscat. I don't 
know what the time difference is; the map suggests four hours. This 
will mean little waiting round at Muscat, fortunately. British Airways
have now gone in for non-stop videos (including the safety spiel).
None of it tempts me. They even provided a long-out-of-date ITN news
 --- first reports of the earthquake in Armenia, Gorbachev's speech 
to the UN, the curried egg fuss. The menu is in a little card with 
lilies on the cover. Unfortunately the food doesn't live up to it. 
The carrots, cooked from frozen, were still frozen on the inside, 
while the peas had dried out.
<p>
I'm most way through the Mary Wesley novel, and got the new Peter
Carey in Gatwick. In paperback remarkable quickly for a Booker Prize 
winner, I thought; but I suppose that means the hardback market gets 
saturated quite fast.
<p>
Change of pressure then. My ears feel it.

<h4>1830</h4>

My neighbour has advanced his watch three hours, so I did likewise.
<p>
In the event, I watched the film, `Crocodile Dundee II' --- the
new-style headphones are more comfortable. I also finished the book. 
The film was far too much over the top for my taste --- not only does 
the hero always win, but he never uses a gun and he never kills his 
opponents --- and even the Australian scenery (on a dim flickering
screen) didn't appeal. But the Mary Wesley book was good, rather like
`Moon Tiger' by another old woman, really a book about the war with 
only brief updating.
<p>
Dark has fallen. I'm going to be so tired.

<h4>1916</h4>

Coming in to land at Dhahran. We are not allowed off the plane, and
have been given dire warnings about handing in empty wine bottles and
spirits miniatures, and for those disembarking, not taking any alcohol
with them. Interesting, isn't it? This attitude, on the face of it far
more consistent than that of the West which sanctions alcohol while
treating hard and soft drugs together, is presumably in fact based on
Islamic law.
<p>
There are now lights below us. My ears hurt like anything, but apart
from that I feel tolerably OK. I took two paracetamol at breakfast
time; either that or the fact that I really am getting better has
got me thus far.
<p>
I'm still nervous, but I think this is a permanent condition of
travelling. When I went to the Indian High Commission for a visa,
the official said I looked frightened in the photograph, and didn't
I like travelling? (I only had to pay 2 pounds 50 for my visa, apparently
a gesture from the Indian government to the Australian to celebrate
the bicentenary. Had I been British, it would have been 21 pounds.)
<p>
Incidentally, photography is also prohibited in Saudi Arabia. Also
Islamic law?

<h4>2117</h4>

On to Muscat time, another hour on. The plane nearly emptied out at
Dhahran, and the kids on board (rejoining their parents in Muscat for
Christmas after their prep schools in England broke up for the hols)
are going to rampage on this leg. It doesn't help that at the moment
there is some delay; we can't even taxi down to the start of the
runway because one plane is taking off and two more landing.
<p>
A child was just belted for misbehaving. Things may improve.
<p>
The second plane is now down. Will they let us off now?
<p>
Going through the list of duty-free allowances, one sees that quite a
few Islamic states (though far from the majority) have an allowance of
Nil for duty-free alcohol --- one infers that this means you can bring
the stuff in if you pay --- but only Saudi Arabia says `Strictly
Prohibited'.
<p>
Yes, we're off. Curiously, we took off in the opposite direction to the
other planes, which might make sense if there were no wind; but, on the
way in, there was quite a lot of buffeting, which was blamed on wind.
Perhaps wind but not at ground level.

<h4>12/12/88, 0018</h4>

Not a couple of hours I want to repeat, though I have to do so
in two weeks' time.
<p>
Initially the airport at Muscat was very impressive, unmistakably
Islamic; the entry point (from the transit bus) was palatial, pillared
and terrazzo-floored. But inside it was just the sort of place to make
me very nervous. There was a transit passenger desk, but nobody
manning it. I went through security and asked at a passenger
information window which was chiefly concerned, seemingly, with
giving out some kind of documentation to returning Britons before
they went through Immigration. The man there took me out to the
transit desk, where he took my ticket and gave me an incorrectly
filled out pink slip without even my name on it. There he left me
for some time, finally taking me and two other transit passengers
by bus some fifty yards from arrival to departure. This at least
was not so frightening, having various shops, telephones, toilets,
etc. But my ticket didn't come back until five minutes after the
flight had been called. I found it quite difficult to relax during
that time, so I started `Oscar and Lucinda'. Fortunately it is a
book for taking in small doses.
<p>
Now at last I am on a plane which will soon take me to India. I
couldn't have fancied a protracted stopover in Muscat!
<p>
To add to my torture, I now have an earache, the result of the
repeated compression and decompression on a head full of cold.
And my bags have been X-rayed so many times that I dread to think
what my film will be like.

<h4>0129</h4>

Things are always better in the air. My mood goes up and down with
the plane. (Clearly it is the higher rather than the lower pressure
that hurts my ears.)
<p>
What a different flight this is. Pretty stewardesses, several of them
Chinese or Thai; quite different music on the headphones (Arab, Indian,
Chinese), even an Indian film with Arabic subtitles. And a much more
interesting meal, minty cucumber, paneer with allo and biryani rice,
pickle and pita bread, and, incongruously, crumble and cream. (The
alternative menu was tandoori chicken, but there seemed to be more demand
for it than for the vegetarian dish, and I was more than happy to even
things out.)
<p>
The flight time to Bombay is less than two hours. I don't yet know
what the time difference is, but it seems fairly clear that I will
arrive at some ungodly hour of the morning, and there'll be another
long wait in store for me. Never mind, there may be the chance to
kip a little, and there won't be the nervousness of Muscat.
(That was a very pointed lesson to me --- I need to practise
meditation. I was quite unable to keep still for a couple of
minutes at a stretch there.)
<p>
The in-flight magazine tempted me enough to persuade me to take one,
even though it'll probably be the same when I come back. The Arabic
text is presumably quite different from the English; certainly it
comes with a completely different selection of pictures.

<h4>0830</h4>

I let myself be importuned by a hotel courier at the airport --- and
it seems to have worked.
<p>
The first thing he informed me about (after giving me the hotel card) was
the time of flights to Calcutta - 5.30am (which I'd missed)  and 4.40pm
- so why didn't I go and rest in the hotel and they'd take me to catch
the plane in good time. When I explained about not having a ticket, no
problem, go to the hotel, then we'll go to the Indian Airlines counter and
you can book. That finally decided me. So we rode in the hotel minibus, I
left my thing in my room, and we went back to the airport via hotel bus
and motorized three-wheel rickshaw taxi.
<p>
After queueing for 30 minutes, I found that all I could get was 64th
place on the waiting list for tonight, and 7th for tomorrow - the
latter, the girl assures me, is almost certain to be good enough. And
tomorrow will get me to Calcutta in good time, if it works. I notice that
Indian Airlines are much fiercer on queue discipline than the Immigration
authorities!
<p>
First impressions of Bombay - people going to work at 6am to beat the
rush; joggers at this early hour too; human habitations in all sorts
of ancient crumbling buildings; rural scenes which could be anywhere
in the world a short distance from the international airport (the
trees not even distinctive); a different smell, but I'm not too
strong on smells, especially at present.
<p>
The hotel courier would do a deal on anything. I accepted his offer of a
sightseeing trip today; I refused his offer to buy one of my jackets.

<h4>1913</h4>
The tour of Bombay was an experience, though not always what I
wanted and certainly more expensive than I intended. The drive to town
seemed never-ending, the traffic incredible all the way, especially in the
way it keeps flowing through much smaller gaps than it would in Europe.
The use of the horn is different, too, with an element of aggression in
it and certainly a function of traffic density. (All trucks carry the
legend on the back, "Horn OK please".) The guide was interested in
pointing out to me the big buildings, hospitals, oil companies, etc., 
whereas I'd have rather heard about the street markets. His English
wasn't really good enough to facilitate much give-and-take in the
conversation, so I had to make do with what he offered.
<p>
The first two stops were a mosque (Haji Ali, on an island reached by a
causeway which is submerged at high tide), and a temple (Mahalakshmi,
on the shore but in the middle of busy streets). At first sight the
similarities were striking and surprising - no doubt this is a very
Indian form of Islam. But the subtle contrasts were telling, too. At Haji
Ali, we bought some flower petals in a packet, gave them to the officiator
in the shrine which was a tomb surmounted by a dome with abstract patterns
and Arabic script in dazzling reflective silver and gold. He tipped them
onto a heap at one end of the tomb. The postulant was permitted to touch
them, then file around to the other end and touch his forehead on some
part of the structure. Outside, there were sellers of all kinds of things,
postcards, artefacts, food, etc., as well as a large number of beggars,
many maimed. At the temple, we bought a basket with an arrangement of
fruit, flowers and coconut. Certain pieces were retained for the deity,
and the coconut containing some sweets (one of which I ate) was returned;
you then seemed to have the option of various things, warming your hands
over a sacred flame, touching part of the shrine, or putting a red spot
on your forehead. This time, almost all the stalls sold the
carefully-arranged flowers and fruit (some of which was of another type,
which you got to keep). There were many fewer beggars, but somehow a much
livelier atmosphere; priests and a cow wandered the streets as cars drove
by, tooting them out of the way. (It was very narrow, and not even the
most dignified are spared.)
<p>
In neither  place was there any indication of what the ritual is for,
whether for god, believer, or everyone, in commemoration of something
past or as a present event with its own significance, or what. The strong
suspicion was that it was just to fleece the tourists, and yet there were
very few tourists compared to the number of local people.
<p>
On the subject of wealth and poverty: This city certainly doesn't
convey an impression of poverty. The first overwhelming impression
is of the sheer number of people; but they are not sitting idly,
but living as hard as they can: driving, cycling, or walking
purposefully in huge streams, making noise, and even if sitting
at a stall, making or doing something. There are of course beggars,
the small children who touch your arm and look at you wide-eyed about
which one hears, and a few lame, legless or armless, but even these
are more often busy near a traffic light, dodging and weaving among
the traffic after their prey while the light is red. On the other
hand, there are surprisingly many advertisements for new investment
opportunities. (English is the language of advertising here; the vast
proportion of the billboards are English only.)
<p>
Then to the Hanging Gardens, built on top of a reservoir on the top of a
high hill and spilling down the sides, complete with a bestiary (including
Hanuman along with the more familiar) in topiary, and the old woman who
lived in a shoe (the shoe is about 20 feet high with a staircase for the
children to climb), along with a stunning view of Chowpatty Beach.
<p>
Next we went to the Gate of India, a huge gate with lattice windows on the
waterfront, with old and new versions of a grand hotel (very expensive)
behind. By this time I was getting so tired that I was just taking
snapshots; indeed I don't have very high hopes for this film (what
is left of it after the X-rays have done their worst). We looked at
various other public buildings (such as the railway station, which is
really something else) without getting out of the car. Then I opted for
lunch (which was huge, far more than I needed, and I am paying for it
now with a disordered tummy), and back to the hotel for a kip. The wrong
time of day, I know, but I couldn't keep my eyes open on the long drive
back. Inevitably, once I got to my room, sleep was much harder to
come by. And now I have to last until the time the plane leaves in the
morning - and if I don't get on it I don't know what I'll do.
<p>
Now, of course, sleep eludes me completely; I feel low, fear the worst,
and begin to ache again after a remarkably symptom-free day.

<h4>13/12/88, 0628</h4>

Roused from sleep by a call from the desk at 10.30pm, I had
trouble getting back again, and didn't succeed until 1am, whereupon
I was deeply asleep when woken up to check out and come to the
airport. Of course I stood in the wrong queue, not understanding
the waiting procedure. Fortunately the flight was 2 hours delayed,
and my courier from the hotel managed to persuade them to let me
jump the queue (apparently it was a pretty sure thing I'd make
it anyway). In fact I've already had my free refreshments (on
account of the delay) and gone through security even before the
announced time for giving out the places. I saw this done on an
earlier flight. The passengers form a scrum, holding their tickets
in the air. Then an official reads out names from a computer listing.
If you're there, you claim your place. If not, presumably, you don't
--- except that people shut and interrupt him and it may be
possible to get him to backtrack. I think that, as Michel observed,
I would not do well in a third world country. The combination of
patience and pushiness required is quite foreign to me; I have both
these characteristics to some extent, but would use them at quite
inappropriate moments.
<p>
There is a screen opposite me flashing out, `Aristogags from Aristocrat
Luggage', things along the line of
<blockquote>
     Mother: What did you learn on your first day of school?<br>
     Johnny: Not much. I have to go back tomorrow.
</blockquote>

It's very difficult to focus my mind on mathematics. I suppose that
being at the conference will help. But at least this morning I tried,
with some apparent success. I thought about covers of geometries whose
blocks are cliques in the adjacency graph, thought of as graph covers
trivial on blocks. Surely the universal object is indeed described by
the fundamental group of the complex whose simplexes are subsets of
blocks; surely, too, it is trivial for the 16-point EGQ(2,1) (though the
proof is certainly not by combinatorial group theory!)
<p>
I suppose they expect us to board fairly soon, or they would not have
let us in here.

<h4>1141</h4>

And then everything went swimmingly. Apart from a long delay in getting
the air conditioning on the plane switched on, and quite a lot of
turbulence on the way, the flight was uneventful, and we arrived in
Calcutta just before 10. There were people from the conference meeting
the flight; I think they were a little bit taken aback to find a
foreigner, unannounced, but the wonderful Indian hospitality was well
up to the challenge. I had a ride to the ISI with the other arriving
visitor, and registered, strolled around the grounds, and here I am,
taking it easy before lunch.
<p>
Calcutta is indeed more crowded than Bombay, but in a different way.
(These are only preliminary observations; the airport is northeast of
the city, the ISI north.) Life is lived on, and in, the street much
more here. There are many more person-drawn wagons sharing the busiest
roads with lorries, buses, bicycles, etc., including one enormously
wide load of straw. Stalls spread out into the road, effectively
narrowing the carriageway, since people walk round them. The shacks
by the roadside have the appearance of shops and businesses rather
than homes. The traffic is noisier and more aggressive; buses, in
particular, are reluctant to give way. The general rule, almost
universally obeyed, is that the person turning or changing lanes
always gives way; the breaches of this I saw were all by buses.
<p>
The shock of arriving at the ISI was very great. From the turmoil of the
street, we turned into what appeared to be a field of chrysanthemums.
The area is a little oasis; a soldier sits in a box at the gate (unarmed,
seemingly, unlike those at the airport) and keeps out disturbers of calm.
<p>
My room sports its own bathroom (with, as usual, basin, taps and shower
discharging onto the floor, with a drainhole in the corner), an overhead
fan, and a mosquito net. I had my first nibble from a mosquito already.
From here, the cries of birds are louder than the perpetual sound of
horns.

<h4>2253</h4>

Tired, won't write for long. But an absolutely marvellous day. Lots of
old friends at lunch, including Jaap and Navin. A very good lunch too,
rice, curry sauce, fish, vegetables, sweet. After lunch Sasha Ivanov
and I talked for quite a long time --- Jaap sat us in a beautifully
finished lounge outside his room, put a beer in front of us, and went
away to finish preparing the talk he was giving at 3.30, the
oft-requested `Non-Euclidean Geometry'. Paternal as ever, in the nicest
possible way. Sasha showed me several very nice things connected with
the amalgam method which he has been working on lately, including my
old characterisation of the cubes et al.; the method extends to the
odd graphs and to dual  polar spaces of type D_n (probably), but the
techniques there get to look very much like mine. Other nice methods
deal with P followed by one or more square nodes. There is a very nice
trick here for showing that the square nodes are really there, which
must be connected with Ronan--Smith and Brouwer--Cohen. (I'm getting
into far more detail than I intended.) I told him mostly about EGQs.
<p>
We heard the last few minutes of Jaap. Getting there at 3.25, I was
surprised to find him still on equiangular lines, but he covered it
all and was only a minute or two over. Then a group of five of us
(Navin, Sharad Sane, Vass, Sasha and I) went down town on the bus.
<p>
The traffic moves very slowly in places, partly because of the
construction work on the Metro, and it was pitch dark when we arrived.
We looked at shops for a while, then went to the New Market. A guide
collared us and took us round; we spent a long time looking at
tablecloths (a local speciality), and less on chess sets of ebony and
sandalwood (Navin says they're better in Bombay); only Vass bought
anything (a tablecloth), but I'll try for chessmen later.
<p>
Then we took the Metro to Kalighat, and went to see the famous
Kali temple. This was much more impressive than the Mahalakshmi.
Removing shoes meant technically all items of leather, though they 
weren't strict; you were shown a very old statue of Kali, much of
gold, with the placing of a red flower and the giving of alms; a
brief fire ceremony; a lingam; a wishing tree; and several other
sites --- and we were only doing a specially negotiated short
tour. I didn't mind making a contribution there. One of the altars
is still used for animal sacrifice, another showed Siva in bed
with several of his consorts (not all at the same time). We got
delicious sweets when we left. It still meant little to me, but
the feeling was much more positive than in Bombay. The temple was
littered with meditators.
<p>
We picked up two beggar girls who accompanied us all the way back
to the tube station, chiefly tormenting Navin (who, unlike most
of us, could understand their song). At the steps, they left him
and turned to me. I said to them, `Namas-te'. Immediately they
stopped their chant, said `O', and left.
<p>
After this we rode back to town and took delicious snacks in an
uncrowded upstairs vegetarian restaurant. Wonderful puris, and
alu and channa concoctions, followed by a milk pudding and two
others of the gulab jamun type. We took a taxi halfway back
(to the end of its range) for a nominal fare, and a bus the
rest of the way for a really derisory sum.
<p>
And so to bed.

<h4>15/12/88, 0658</h4>

Yesterday I missed writing up, but with the conference
properly begun, there was not so much to tell. I slept extremely
soundly, sleeping through (so I'm told) the hot water man, the
tea man, and the laundry man, waking up just in time for breakfast.
<p>
The conference opened at 10.30 with a Vedic hymn, followed by a
short welcome, biographical sketch of Bose, and a talk on
experimental design and sampling techniques. After lunch (out
of a cardboard box in a tent in the garden), things began in
earnest with two sessions of three 25 minute talks. Nothing too
remarkable to report so far, except Chang's talk (which I wish
I'd heard more slowly) on optimality of designs, a concept
which even Jaap managed to get into his talk) and Navin's (the
first time I've ever heard Krull dimension used in a lecture
on <i>t</i>-designs!)
<p>
Among other things, my future arrangements are now somewhat
clearer. It appears that I'll lecture here on the 19th and fly
to Bombay on the morning flight on the 20th. In Bombay I'll
talk at the University (on block-transitive designs), the Tata
Institute (on order-preserving permutations and scaled of
measurement), and at Pune (on infinite permutation groups and
model theory). Pune is three hours by train from Bombay, and
it's said to be a very beautiful train ride. The Tata lecture
will be on the morning of the 26th, the day I leave.
<p>
The last event before supper was the memorial session for Bose,
where a number of people got up and talked about their memories
of him. It was quite unlike any function I've been to before,
and I was struck by several things: the contrasting way in which
the speakers did their jobs; the unlikelihood that any of the
next generation will stand out the way great men like Bose did.
Then supper, after which I retired to write my talk and go to bed.
Once again I slept well, but managed with some effort to tear myself
awake for the hot water man. Now bather and refreshed with tea,
I feel fine. The only problem on the horizon is squeezing my talk
into 25 minutes! (I'm first up this morning.)

<h4>1138</h4> 
Guess what, I have a snuffle today. I'm getting a cold.
<p>
Talk OK, though I went two minutes overtime, to Jaap's annoyance. Not much
reaction yet.
<p>
I'm too nervous, beginning to worry already about getting to Bombay.
Hopefully it will work out. I suppose that at lunchtime I should check.
<p>
Glorious morning, hazy sunshine, warm but not the least hot. View over the
pond very pleasant.

<h4>16/12/88, 0725</h4>

One is so busy that writing doesn't get done. Not only did
I spend the whole day in talks (indeed, in the same room), but I had
conversations with many people, Klin, Khosrovshahi, Bagchi, Ivanovs
(both), etc.
<p>
I didn't manage to confirm my ticket; that'll have to wait until Bombay.
(Air India's computer doesn't talk to either British Airways' or
Gulf Air's.) But other arrangements are going satisfactorily.
<p>
Klin's talk beautiful stuff --- he overlaps with Buczak, as Gol'fand does
with CGS and me. Bagchi: I agree with Jaap's assessment of him. So many
little asides in his talk, full of great knowledge and erudition.
Vijayakumar: I also agree with Jaap there. Other nice things too.
<p>
Photo in the afternoon a jovial affair, lots of fun at the expense of the
photographer, whose assistant carried the umbrella. A huge crowd turned
out to see the photo taken.
<p>
The cultural evening. The performers were delayed, and didn't
make much of an apology for starting an hour late. But never mind.
The dancer, Catapa Dutta Gupta, lovely stuff. My impression was
of the way she danced with her whole body including her face and
(especially) her fingertips. One beautifully dramatic dance on
the subject of Radha's jealous anger at Krishna when he has been
visiting another woman. Then the real treat for me, a performance
by Pundit V. G. Jog. To my dismay, it was cut to half an hour
because of the lateness (`Perhaps the shortest performance he
has ever given,' said the compere.) He played two classical pieces
in the same raga, in 7 and 16 beats, and then a folk song from
Benares. I was absolutely enraptured. My concentration was
really focussed in a way it hasn't been for a very long time,
and never wavered for a moment. Afterwards I got his autograph,
and talked a little bit with one of his disciples. His violin had
5 strings (I think, possibly even 6), tuned D A D A D.
<p>
After dinner there was a party, an `alcohol party', hence not an
official part of the proceedings. I stayed quite late and enjoyed
myself, trying various Indian brews and talking to quite a lot of
people. Very nice.

<h4>17/12/88, 1831</h4> 

Another big gap. The conference schedule was, as ever, very
tight, but everything was over by teatime and I was able to get a bit of
sleep before dinner. I have my plane ticket and 6000 rupees. Everything
is fine.
<p>
My complaint about the food is that, though good, it is entirely
repetitious. At least this will change in Bombay.
<p>
After supper word went round that there was another party. So we
trooped off to the roof of the building where Jaap is staying, and
stood around up there drinking beer, Russian cognac (very good) and
Indian rum, eating salmon and chicken p&acirc;t&eacute; (also from the Soviet
Union) and talking more and more loudly as the evening wore on.
It was a little cooler than it had been. I'm told this is a small
lull in the rainy season.
<p>
Then I was woken up at 3.00 by the Russians leaving to catch their
early flight, and for good at 6.00. I picked up my laundry from
the laundry man, but somehow managed to miss tea.
<p>
After breakfast it was straight onto the coach, which didn't leave
immediately (the story of the day). Three temples today, and any
resemblance among them entirely coincidental. The first one, whose
name I forget, was a Kali temple founded by a woman (instructed
in a dream) around 1850. It was far more spacious than Kalighat,
a huge courtyard with long queues of people waiting to offer their
devotions to the image in the main temple, a bookstall, twelve small
temples to twelve manifestations of Siva, each containing a
flower-decked lingam, most being watered. This side overlooked
the River Hoogly over a rose garden. Outside were five sacred
fig trees with cows and people under them. I bought two books by
Swami Vivekananda, addresses in Chicago at a `Parliament of
Religions' and one on karma yoga. A most colourful place but
with none of the frenzy of Kalighat.
<p>
We drove over the bridge to the west bank of the Hoogly, and were
soon at the Ramakrishna temple. Here you see a link, in that
Vivekenanda was Ramakrishna's chief disciple. But what a difference.
This was the intellectual, abstract Hinduism. The main building
illustrated Ramakrishna's teaching of religious tolerance, being
a mixture of styles illustrative of all the main world religions.
Inside was a vast, cool hall; at the front, a few people knelt
while a priest tended a sacred fire in front of a marble statue
of the saint. Outside, we saw on the river bank the spot where
he was cremated, and various similar buildings. The river hazed
away in the distance, and someone poled a small boat past while
several monks swam, just as in the pictures. It was very pleasant,
with lawns and flowering trees. Apparently this is a missionary
or serving order, but their headquarters showed little sign of
the world.
<p>
A long drive through the country, on the Bombay road, took us to
our next stop. (It was interesting, at a fork in the road, to see
signs to Delhi and Bombay. Clearly a mistake would be costly.) We
passed little tile-roofed villages on the banks of ponds, under
palm and banana trees; people worked in paddy fields, cows lay on
the grass. The road was surprisingly empty. But it got more crowded
as we got back into Howrah, where we went to the Botanic Gardens.
<p>
There wasn't time to let us get out and walk. We were taken round by
bus and shown the palms, the Australasian trees, Calcutta port across
the river, and so on. Finally we stopped for the one short walk of
the trip, to the famous banyan tree. It was very impressive. Five
years ago they fenced it in and built a road around, and it has
already got over the road and is marching further out. There we
had coconuts; someone (I think Jaap) paid for  the whole party.
Very tasty. The other wonder we saw was the `mad tree', of which
every leaf is (entirely) different in shape.
<p>
Now for the famous Howrah Bridge. The traffic was just amazing. I didn't
see how long it took us to cross the river. At one stage we were belting
along the tramlines the wrong way, with a stream of traffic outside us,
when a tram came. So the driver just moved further over into the
oncoming traffic. At the far side of the bridge, a bus decided not to
let us back in, and some hasty words were spoken.
<p>
After driving round the racecourse (unnecessarily, it seemed to me), we
stopped at the park by the Victoria Memorial for lunch. After going to
the toilet (a very long trek by crocodile, asking the way from time to
time, to the delight of the onlookers) and having lunch, I didn't want
to see the memorial itself, but sat in the sun with Eiichi and two
students for half an hour. A beggar woman with a baby came up; I didn't
give her any money until she told me I looked like some famous Hindi
film star, at which my heart was softened. (Earlier, at the first temple,
I'd been compared to both Abraham Lincoln and Omar Khayyam.)
<p>
Huge wide park with neat palm trees, and this white monstrosity on the
river bank. On top of the dome was an angel, and the students argued
about it. It turns in the wind, said one. No, there's a motor, said the
other.
<p>
Outside, the monkey man and the flute man tried their wiles on us without
success. Jaap did slightly better in getting us to line up for a photo.
<p>
Then, time being short (largely because of the bridge), it was either
museum or shopping. I opted for the latter, as did almost all the party.
Most of them went to New Market, but Vass and I tried for the Cottage
Industries Emporium (government controlled, hence prices fixed). It was
closed, but we found the Kashmir Emporium and went there instead. After
drooling over some beautiful carpets, I bought two silk sarees (huge long
things) and an embroidered top and trousers outfit which can be made up
to the right size. I saved the tax: the assistant forgot to charge me for
one saree, and was so grateful when I pointed it out (I guess he would
have had to pay) that he knocked the tax off. This surprised me a bit:
does he have to make it up, or is it discretionary?
<p>
Anyway, on the way home, we stopped at an amazing Jain temple.
Built by a man with the money he made selling jewels to Queen
Victoria (and he looked it, despite the prayerful attitude, in
a wonderfully lively statue), it was a temple for the play of
light: glass mosaics, 108-lamp crystal chandelier from Paris
over the main shrine, hexagonal mirrors, facing mirrors (the guide
did match tricks at the last two of these). Outside, formal gardens
filled with quite amazing statuary. I asked the guide (while we
were off having a cold drink afterwards), why mirrors? What is
their religious significance? It's just for beautification, he said.

<h4>2036</h4>

Should I describe details, to keep them safe? My room: double doors of
dark wood opening inward, covered by a curtain, fastened by a padlock through
two ring handles. Sky-blue walls and ceiling, cork tile floor, lit by a
naked fluorescent. (The bathroom is two shades of green, concrete for easy
swilling out, lit by a bare bulb.) Bed: hard board, blanket and quilt over
a sheet, mosquito net. (But there are surprisingly few mosquitoes around.)
An old clothes cupboard on which generations of students (one from
Indonesia) have written.

<h4>18/12/88, 0658</h4> 

It seems that  the hot water and tea men take Sunday off. A
pity: I was really looking forward to a good wash today. I got very grimy
yesterday, and I have a sore throat, which I'm sure is caused by the
exhaust fumes. Once, on the bus, I noticed clouds of smoke rising from
under my seat; I'm sure the exhaust system of the bus was in bad shape.
<p>
Vivekananda in Chicago, stressing the tolerance of Hinduism, strikes a sour
note himself in his discussion of Buddhism when he claims that Hindus
understand the Buddha's message better than Buddhists do. (He even claims
that Hindus reverence Buddha as a god; certainly the Theravada Buddhists
do not, and they would say that he never claimed to be one.) Basically
Vivekananda cannot accept the Buddha's denial of an eternal soul; it is
so obvious to him that souls exist that he simply ignores this. Then he
goes on to deplore the fact that the Buddha's reforming message was not
accepted into mainstream Hinduism.

<h4>0908</h4> 

Most people went into town today, but I intend a quiet day; I'll go
for a walk, get some work done, and so on. I went for a stroll round the
grounds after breakfast. I expect that most of the photos I've taken will
be very poor, because they were snapped in such a rush. (I really should
get an automatic compact for trips like this.) But today I was able to
put a little more consideration into my photography.
<p>
The hot water man didn't come because he thought I'd left. He is
going to bring some in 15 minutes. Now, I hope, everyone knows
that I am staying. Khosrovshahi wanted to move into the guest
house to ensure his hot water, but wasn't able to, because it
is full with another group. The students, apparently, come back
on the 24th.
<p>
Twice on television there have been snatches of Christmas carols.
I don't feel nostalgic for them in the least. But the second time
(when I was actually watching, rather than overhearing from a
distance), the announcer saw fit to point out that this was a
celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. In India, I think that
is true, though it is certainly not in the West.
<p>
I tried to capture palms, chrysanthemums, and haze in the pictures
I took this morning. These are the dominant impressions of the
Institute. One of the organisers, in the introductory session,
apologizing for the short notice, said that the conference had
spurred the authorities to paint, decorate, gravel the roads,
and generally tidy up the Institute; it had been so effective
that perhaps they should have more international conferences at
short notice. But I failed to get any pictures to contrast the
clamour outside the gates with the peace within. Sound and smell
form such a very large part of the whole experience; I didn't see
any sights that would effectively carry these impressions.
<p>
One of the most colourful sights, actually, and one I shall take away
as a symbol, is the huge number of government-licensed Public Carriers.
Big trucks carrying anything from bricks to aviation spirit, and often
with many people in the back, they are decorated with colourful
patterns, a religious-type picture, coloured tinsel, and lights.

<h4>1008</h4>

Now thoroughly washed in hot water, I feel much better. Huge
quantities of grime came out in the scrubbing. I plan to work in the
morning and go for a walk after lunch. Now I'm sitting on a step in the
shade, looking over the pond.
<p>
A comment from the memorial session comes to mind, in connection with
the nature of Hinduism. The statement "Only Hindus can do experimental
design" was attributed to Bose. It is often necessary to think of lines
as points, pairs of points as blocks, etc.; Hindus are very used to
worshipping the same God in many different guises. Kulkarni explained
to me yesterday (and I think I have it right) that Siva represents
the unchangeable essence, Kali is the maya or appearance. He used
the analogy of a cobra. When it's still, it represents Siva; when
it moves, Kali.

<h4>1152</h4> 

After retrieving, with some difficulty, the proof that 
<i>v</i>&lt;=(<i>k</i>-2)<sup>2</sup>
for a flag-transitive 2-design, I decided to go for a walk. Not
far; I headed in along the road towards town for about 20 minutes,
then turned around to come back. This was what I'd seen from buses
and cars, but much more immediately: the hive of activity on the
street, even (if that term applies) on a Sunday morning.
<p>
The most popular activities apart from talking seemed to be
washing --- bodies (male only) and clothes --- in the water that
flowed from hosepipes at intervals along the road, and mending
vehicles (anything from changing a bicycle tyre to major
reconstruction work on the engine of a big truck); but, as well,
people were riding in cycle rickshaws dressed in their Sunday best,
butchering, trimming bamboo poles, mixing cement, eating and
drinking, doing carpentry, etc.
<p>
On the way back, I fell in with a man walking home (he lived in a 
house opposite the Institute). He asked me if I felt cold. With
the sun blazing on my back through the haze, in mid-December?)
He told me that he had visited England in the past, but cannot
now get a visa, the immigration officials are too strict. He has
friends who live in Putney High Street and run a restaurant. He
warned me not to trust anybody, and to be especially careful of
pickpockets in Bombay.

<h4>1447</h4> 
I'm standing at Ballyghat, on the western support of the bridge,
looking across at the Kali temple, at the halfway point of my walk.
There are so many things I haven't said yet. Some contrasts:
<ol>
<li>Next door to an army barracks, an ashram and yoga hospital.
<li> Right in front of the Institute (but I hadn't seen it before,
because we don't go that way) is a lean-to of blackened hessian
among piles of rubbish. In front of it, a family were doing their
washing in the dirty drain, with a fly-blown dead pig on the
other side.
</ol>
And I haven't said yet about kids playing cricket everywhere.
<p>
Today's photos may be a bit better. In particular, one of a
bridge-painter, the girders behind him framing the temple.

<h4>1553</h4>

The squalor of this place, it must be said, is due to people's
tendency to throw their rubbish away just outside the door. So,
when they took down the tent where we had our meals, you could
see that all the scraps had been poked behind the canvas and
left there. Far worse are the piles of decaying rubbish in the street.
<p>
I saw two of the less attractive occupations of Calcuttans today.
One is searching through piles of junk for saleable items. The
other is making cowpats (for fuel, I suppose), which includes in
its manufacture stages involving pouring on water and mixing to
a paste with your hands, then slapping it in concrete surfaces
(e.g. drainpipes) to dry, afterwards collecting up the pats
and sorting them. (But I believe that in Victorian London, people
made their living collecting dog turds to add colour to tanned
leather.)
<p>
I also noticed that there are many more temples than I thought.
I saw half a dozen on my walk today; most were quite tiny.

<h4>19/12/88, 0912</h4> 

Having arrived too early, and finding no-one else in yet,
I walked on and found a seat on a root of a tree overlooking a
big pond. Today feels like a good day.
<p>
Last night I drank a couple of beers with Khosrovshahi and Ito,
and we discussed India. I found that when I tried to express
myself, despite my true feelings, it came out sounding like a
diatribe against the filth and squalor of the people. And yet I
only said things which I've written in this notebook, which I
believe gives a much more balanced account of my reaction.
<p>
One analogy that occurred to me. The householders keeping
themselves and their houses clean and dumping the rubbish
outside the front door are something like the meditators in
the temple, who seemingly don't notice the noise and bustle
around them as they purify their inner selves. It is all
a question of what things you notice and what you don't.
<p>
I slept very soundly and was grateful that the hot water man was
late today. The laundry man says my clothes will be ready by 7pm
tonight.

<h4>1305</h4> 

Nobody showed up until after 10.30: at 9.00 the building was full
of cleaners, and when they left at 10.30 the academics arrived. I
had a cup of tea and a chat with Bagchi and Vijayan before my talk
at 11.00. I think it was a good lecture. I didn't have a lot of
feedback, but that seems to be the way here; I hope that I have
planted this seed in fertile soil.
<p>
On the way back to lunch, I stopped at the Post Office, and bought
enough stamps for five postcards. I sent one off, and will
presumably send more, though perhaps not all five --- I can't
imagine that many will get home before I do. And of course, though
I don't now need a post office, I do need a pillar box. One
feature of the box here is its spurious precision about collection
times: 10.46am, 1.46pm. The former was still displayed nearly two
hours later when I posted the card.

<h4>1750</h4> 

Now the other lecture is finished --- a smaller audience but
just as keen --- and my duties here are over. Tomorrow the car
will take me to the airport at 7am.
<p>
Bagchi has just given me copies of his inversive planes papers
with Sastry. Curiously, they can't resolve exactly what the
dimension of the binary code of W(s) is for s even; they have a
conjecture which they believe to be true, and what they can prove
already refutes a theorem of Bob Liebler (with a p-adic proof).
Altogether it's beautiful stuff, including the following gem.
The set of absolute points of a polarity of any incidence
structure belongs to the binary code of the structure.

<h4>20/12/88, 0554</h4>

A really terrible experience last night. I'd gone to bed
early in preparation for getting up in time to catch the 8.45am
flight this morning. I'd not been able to get to sleep properly,
I thought because the traffic and the dogs were noisier than usual.
Then at about 11.45pm I woke up with the most intense stomach pain
I've ever had. Sweat poured off me; going to the toilet didn't
help, and I couldn't bring up my dinner. Lying down was agony,
and even sitting  was too uncomfortable; walking around was the
least unpleasant position. I took two paracetamol tablets, chewing
them in the hope that the bitter taste might help bring up the
dinner, which I held to blame. Gradually the pain receded; there
were two further waves, less severe than the first, and then it went
completely and I was able to sleep soundly.
<p>
At first I assumed that the fish was bad. Later I wondered if rather
I had swallowed a fishbone, and the pain was caused by it passing
undigested through some sensitive tract. I certainly could do
without any recurrence of that!
<p>
Now the hot water man has been; I've bathed, and feel quite good. The
car was due at 7.00, but Khosrovshahi, a worrier, asked them to send
it at 6.30 instead. So I'd better dress.
<p>
Last night, before bed, I made some progress on <i>r</i>-cliques of blocks in
S(2,<i>k</i>,<i>v</i>), which I'd discussed with Bagchi. Trivially, if the 
design has more points than projective 3-space, then any <i>r</i>-clique is a 
star; but this is false for projective 3-space and several related designs.
Now I've shown that if the number of points lies strictly between a
unital and a projective 3-space, then any <i>r</i>-clique is a star. He needed
this conclusion for a unital of order 3. I'm sure that the result can be
pushed further!

<h4>21/12/88, 0912</h4> 

The trip to the airport and the flight to Bombay went without
incident. The plane was only about 3/4 hour late, and I gave
Reza Khosrovshahi my lecture on block-transitive designs.
<p>
Navin and the young guy from the University were waiting for
us at the airport. We went by taxi to the University, quite a
short journey; traffic seemed almost nonexistent, such a contrast
it was with Calcutta. There was some trouble finding me a room
in the hostel. (I learned later from Vass that the young guy on
the door at the time is perpetually on the make, and  creates
difficulties in the hope of resolving them for money.) Then we went 
for lunch, absolutely delicious, with members of the conference on
commutative algebra and combinatorics going on here. Served on a
tin tray, with little tin cups for the curry and dahl, the rest
piled up on the tray (rice and two delicious vegetable concoctions,
and really fantastic parathas). I ate too much! Then a delicate
dessert and coffee. After lunch, I went to one of the conference
lectures, introductory ring theory, but had difficulty keeping my
eyes open. Then Sharad Sane and I had a go at a problem of his:
is it true that, in any S(2,<i>k</i>,<i>v</i>) which is not a projective 
plane, it is possible to cover all points with <i>r</i> blocks, not using all 
the blocks on a point? (Reminiscent of the one before!) The motivation
is that, if true, it would show that the only S(2,<i>k</i>,<i>v</i>)s whose
duals are maximal cliques of <i>r</i>-sets are projective planes. It's
an odd sort of problem: you can exclude <i>k</i>=3, any system having
a subsystem, and classical unitals; what you end up with is that
a counterexample contains none of a long list of configurations.
Also, you can exclude systems containing a spread, or indeed a
large partial spread. The only general approach I can see would be
to show that the non-existence of configurations allows results about
partial spreads to be sufficiently strengthened to apply the previous
statement.
<p>
Then Vass, Willem and  I went to a restaurant Vass knows in
Santa Cruz near the station. We went there by autorickshaw;
the driver tried to charge us 15 rupees, but a bystander said
that the fare should be 5.75 only. The restaurant was very like
one in England; we had chicken jalfrezi, biryani, sag paneer,
stuffed paratha, and plenty of beer. Very good for 4 pounds.
<p>
Coming back was an adventure. We decided to take the bus. The bus
came in and stood, revving its engine impatiently, while the queue
of passengers struggled to get on, impeding one another and being
very much slower than they might have been (prisoner's dilemma).
When he thought he'd waited long enough, the driver just went.
I was on, but Vass and Willem were left behind. When I paid my
fare (half a rupee, 2p), the conductor indicated that he'd tell
me where to get off, and he did, though it wasn't a junction I
recognised. Some people in the street directed me down a road
turning off to the left. I walked along it, feeling perfectly
safe, but realising I was alone at night in a huge and strange
city with no very clear idea where I was. I knew that, at worst,
I would be able to retrace my steps to the bus stop and take an
autorickshaw from there. But I came to a gate with a notice on it;
as I stepped up to read the notice, I recognised the University.
When I got to the hostel, there was no sign of Willem or Vass,
but they came down in a few minutes to look for me, clearly a trifle
worried.
<p>
I slept reasonably in such a spartan room without a mosquito net. 
When I awoke and looked in the mirror, I saw that my face was
absolutely covered with red spots. Vass has given me his repellant
and anti-histamine (he leaves today), and I will try to get a
mosquito net for tonight; but there is nothing to hang it on.
<p>
I went back to the canteen where we had lunch to see about
breakfast --- Vass said there was a conference breakfast at
8.00. But only the regular downstairs canteen was available,
so I went there. Soon afterwards, Willem came in. Breakfast,
it seems, is an omelette (as in Calcutta) --- nothing else is
possible. I said yes to an omelette, but Willem tried `Boiled
egg?' `No.' `Sandwich?' `Omelette sandwich.' That's what he got,
and it's what I got too, but Vass, who came in soon afterwards,
succeeded in getting the omelette separate from the bread-and-butter.

<h4>22/12/88, 0743</h4>

After breakfast, the three of us went to Santa Cruz and went round
the shopping area. We didn't actually buy much --- a cold drink,
a mosquito-killing gadget, some comic-book retellings of stories
from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana for the kids (they even had
one about Jesus), some sweets , and lunch in a small cafe (pav bhaji
which was too hot for Vass but which I enjoyed, while Willem had a
cheese sandwich, divine mango milkshake, and lassi which was also
very good) --- but, as well, I spent a while in a silk shop looking
at quite expensive, elaborately embroidered dresses, up to
2000 rupees. I've just realised how short my time is; I might
have to go back there this morning.
<p>
The thing I most enjoyed looking at in the shopping area was the
vegetables. Perfect quality in most cases; each one individually
inspected by the vendor before being placed in a neat pile,
blemished and hairs removed. Garlic is sold both in bulbs and
separated into cloves. Many things I couldn't name as well as
those I could.

<h4>0843</h4>
When we got back, a shock awaited me. Before going down town,
I had gone back to the travel agent to confirm my reservation.
British Airways worked fine but Gulf Air proved inaccessible.
So when I returned, he tried them again. He got through after
a long delay, only to be told that I didn't exist on their
computer! He made another reservation, but my ticket and passport
had to be sent down town to finalise the details, for some reason
which is not clear to me. One dreads to imagine the possible things
that can go wrong in this situation.
<p>
Anyway, I trustingly handed over the documents --- he seemed to know what
he was about --- and we went back to the University. No-one was about, so
the three of us sat in an empty seminar room and talked about mathematics.
Finally Sane and Verma came,  we had tea and went to the canteen for a
cold drink, and got back after the due time for my talk.
<p>
There was quite a bit audience. I wasn't introduced, just started.
(Sane is very unassuming. Rao gave me a grandiloquent introduction
to a much smaller audience in Calcutta.) It went well --- several
members of the audience were very much on the ball.
<p>
Two to go.
<p>
After the talk, I spoke some more with Sharad, and then at Willem's
instigation, he, Vass and I went for a couple of beers. It wasn't
really necessary, but I was so terribly thirsty all day! Actually, one
would have sufficed. We went to the Sane's place at 8.00, bearing gifts.
(Three people with initials S. S. S. Willem had brought Droste's 
chocolate letters, but wasn't able to get S because it was the feast of
Sinta Claes when he left!)
<p>
We had a delightful evening - lots of good talk and good food, more beer.
Then we went back to the hostel and saw Vass on his way, and I went to bed.
<p>
This morning, the boy had reported to Willem that I was sick, or so he
understood, perhaps wrongly. Indeed I'd been up a couple of times in the
night with a runny tummy - it has been a bit this way the whole time,
probably due at least in part to the malaria pills - but sick, no.
Nor mosquitoes tonight, either. There were very few in the room to begin
with, and these seemed to succumb to the electric gadget I got yesterday.
The old spots seem less noticeable today, and I can't see any new ones.

<h4>1134</h4> 

After seeing Willem off to the Tata, I went to the post office and
sent off a postcard, bought a couple of tin mugs and a cake of soap,
sat in the corner caf&eacute;  under an umbrella and a eucalypt drinking
orange juice with nutmeg, and then wandered round the campus taking
a few photographs and using up my second film. Then I came back to
my room where I've had an easy morning - resting, reading India
Today, the kids' comics, and more of Oscar and Lucinda. There is
a definite feeling of things drawing to a close.
<p>
Flying into Bombay, we passed over some very rugged, bare brown hills,
and plains with curious straight line markings on them.

<h4>1742</h4>

After writing the last bit, I lay down for a rest, and found 
it quite difficult to bring myself back to consciousness in
time for lunch. So, obviously, I didn't feel very hungry. I found
Verma there --- he put away huge quantities of food, but I had
only one small second helping of rice and chick peas. (Everybody
else had gone by that stage, even though I was one of the
first to arrive.) 
<p>
After lunch I went back to the department with Sane, and we worked
all afternoon on his problem. We came up with an elegant trick.
Rather than straining too hard for a large partial spread, we
decided to add lines satisfying the following conditions: each
line disjoint from the preceding ones up to the trivial lower
bound for a partial spread; then each line picking up three new
points as long as this is possible (assuming k=4); and finally
lines picking up points  two at a time, as long as this is possible.
The hope is that this is sufficient to do the job, but my 
suspicion is that it still fails.
<p>
I also talked for a while to Mrs Bhat-Nayak about the thesis of
a student of hers. They'd found a construction giving 512
non-isomorphic (66,6,5) designs, most of which don't contain
(66,6,1) designs, and all admitting an automorphism of order 65.
But the paper was rejected by the referee whose first criticism
was, `It is easy to construct at least 10<sup>89</sup> such designs by
applying permutations.' I suspect that this was an off-the-cuff
remark which he wouldn't want to be held to, and that in fact
the argument is just plain wrong; in any case, I can't see how
any construction of this sort would give designs with no
(66,6,1) subdesigns. So I was not being hypocritical when
I made sympathetic noises. The offence was compounded by
the fact that a polite enquiry to the journal elicited no reply.
<p>
I went to the travel agent. They said that the messenger was not
back from Bombay yet, and promised to bring my ticket over when
he came. So it looks as if I'm stuck here this evening. I'm not
hungry, and anyway I have some sweets to eat; a day of light eating
will not hurt my digestion.
<p>
The campus has avenues of remarkable trees called ashoka trees.
They are tall and thin, even more so than poplars, but the branches,
instead of growing up, trail downwards, ending in a neat skirt
some distance above ground level (but I don't know if this is
the result of human intervention --- the gardens, paths and
avenues are very well tended here.) I asked Sharad if it was the
same word as the emperor, and he said yes, but the tree is older;
it's mentioned in the Mahabharata. In Sanskrit, it means something
like `showing fortitude'. Other vegetation includes palms, bananas
and bougainvillea. Yet just behind the campus is a wide bare area
on which nothing higher than grass grows.

<h4>1903</h4>

I was sitting here working on the problem, when there was a tap on
the door; three students from Kerala in the south of India, who are
here for the conference on combinatorics and commutative algebra,
were at the door. I invited them in, and after a brief awkwardness
we all sat down and had a long chat about many things, politics,
etc. They told me that the parts of India I should visit are the
two extremes: Kashmir and Kerala. I felt so happy that they'd come;
a lovely gesture.
<p>
Still no sign of my ticket.
<p>
The room has a few mosquitoes in it now, but I have put on the vaporiser,
and the fan will waft the stuff into all corners.

<h4>1915</h4>

The argument indeed didn't quite work. By simple counting, you can
cover about 1/3 of the points by disjoint lines (still <i>k</i>=4), another
1/3 by lines picking up three new points each, and the rest by lines
picking up two new points each. This gives a covering with about
(13/12)<i>r</i> lines; an improvement on the (5/4)<i>r</i> we had before 
(implicitly).

<h4>2043</h4>

The students came back and suggested I go to dinner with them, which
I happily did. Their rooms are near mine, in fact.
<p>
Still no word from the travel agent.

<h4>23/12/88, 0930</h4> 

Depressed. Travel agent closed, nothing to do but wait till
it opens. Unsure of finding time for shopping. Were it not for promises
and deadlines I'd try to make my own way into town this morning and get
back  to Dadar in time to catch the train.
<p>
I zapped the remaining mosquitoes in the room myself before I went
to bed last night. Some doubt must remain about the efficacy of
that Good Knight gadget. I slept well until someone blundered into
my room by mistake at about 2am. They left the light outside
switched on, and I couldn't find the switch to turn it off. Later
I had a vivid dream, which I tried to hold on to, but it gradually
lost its potency and changed from satisfaction to frustration and
a feeling of being lost.
<p>
Physically I feel good this morning; the touch of runny tummy I had has
cleared up. But there is the physical effect of the uncertainty sitting
in the pit of my stomach.
<p>
Willem isn't here. He must have stayed overnight at the Tata. So I won't
see him to say goodbye, and the possibility of getting him to change some
rupees for me does not exist. I went to breakfast at 8.00, then killed time
until 9.00 when I tried the travel agent. Sane wasn't yet in his office.
Now I'm killing time until 10.00 when I'll try the travel agent once again.
<p>
Oh dear.

<h4>1221</h4> 

The travel agent assured me that the job was done and I would have the
ticket at 11.30. On the strength of his assurance, I went into Santa Cruz
in an attempt to get rid of some money. I managed to part with about
600 rupees, half of it on a bag to put the rest in (which I'm now using
as a travelling bag to Pune). The rest was more comic-strip epics from
the Mahabharata, etc., some brassware, and some cold drinks.
<p>
Got back at 12. Sure enough it was there; they charged me 50 rupees
for the job, not at all excessive. Bu

<h4>1412</h4>

Interrupted by a knock at the door. Sharad and Navin were there,
so we went over to have lunch. It wasn't ready when we arrived
there, so we talked for a while, ate (quite frugally) and then
started to make tracks. I'd packed all my things into the new bag,
including camera case; if I do much shopping in Pune (and they
tell me it's good, maybe cheaper than Bombay) I can take the
camera bag out and squeeze more stuff in, which wouldn't have
been possible with my briefcase.
<p>
Navin and I went by taxi to Dadar station, while Sharad took the
water-jug back. It was a fairly long taxi-ride through the slums
of Bombay (though not a patch on those of Calcutta), and then,
after a brief town-centrish part with a couple of temples, streets
of apartment buildings, and so to the station.
<p>
I was glad of Navin's presence. He got a platform ticket, then found the
platform, the reservation list, and finally the coach. But my seat had
been taken by a family and I've ended up sitting somewhere else. I put my
bag down, and we went and had a cold drink and talked for a while. Then he
left. i won't see him again on this trip; he'll be away when I visit the
Tata on Monday.
<p>
First class is certainly much less crowded than the suburban trains
that go by with people hanging out of the doors. Indeed, Navin told
me of an unusual accident, when a goods train hit and bent a metal
spike which proceeded to slice through the legs of the people hanging
on. But we have half a dozen in this compartment already (it's
two-tier). Trains go  past, vendors run stalls or push trolleys
along the platform, everybody talks. Navin says first class costs
about 5 times as much as second. There's an even higher class ---
air-conditioned first class --- which is much more again.
<p>
It's time we left. There's an announcement which I didn't catch. This
station is towards the centre of Bombay from Santa Cruz but not right
in town.

<h4>1512</h4>

We left pretty punctually. After about half an hour of Indian urban,
perhaps a little worse for being seen through the train window, we
came into the country, a flat land of swamps and wide rivers, but
with those incredibly steep bare mountains I saw from the plane
rising abruptly behind it. We passed a village with a gaudy temple,
and a little town. Then we came to the first stop, a place whose
name I can't make out from any signs. Immediately the vendors
flocked round, with juice, tea, sandwiches, samosas, etc. After
the umpteenth time I was tempted by an orange juice, or an orange 
drink as it actually was; never mind, probably more
thirst-quenching so. The right strategy is surely to keep drinking.
<p>
There are eleven human beings in this compartment, including a man
lying on each upper bunk. We also have two old women in white who
sit cross-legged on the seats, and a husband, wife, little girl
and baby, who seem connected with at least one of the women.
<p>
Outside on the platforms, it's even more busy than Dadar, with sellers
and buyers, travellers and well-wishers. Now I suppose we're nearly
off; the bell has clanged twice and a boy in khaki is waving a green
flag.

<h4>1613</h4>

Just at that moment we started to pull out of the station and began
gently climbing, first through a region of small fields enclosed by
grassy hedges, then through a town where we slowed but didn't stop
at the station, built on the banks of a fast-running stream, then
into a much more dramatic dry landscape of brown earth, white grass
(black where burnt), yellow-green cactus-like hedgerows, a few bright
green evergreens, and every now and then a brilliant stab of
bougainvillea or rose. Then mountains started on the left. (I can't
see that side so well because one of the shades is drawn against
the sun.) Like the earlier ones, bare, brown, and very steep, but now
continuous. Then, passing a cricket match on a village green, we made
a short stop at Kayat, though we've just pulled out again. Not so many
vendors here: you had to go out looking for them.
<p>
Cows graze between the tracks in the railway yard.

<h4>1657</h4> 

After that station, we began to climb in earnest, for the most
dramatic section of the trip. The hills switched to the right (I should
say I have my back to the engine), while on the left, real mountains,
heavily wooded, backed a more fertile land. Then we started climbing
the ridge on the left, with  an alternation of tunnels and viaducts
from which you can see the river valley receding. Then, at a certain point,
we went through to the other side of the ridge, giving a long series of
views over a spectacular canyon, the opposite wall nearly sheer, showing
horizontal strata, and higher than us. We wound up this for some time more
until we reached a small station and were at the top. Now the country is
jumbled rolling downs, with a big college on a high bluff overlooking the
river, a new bitumen road, and more human habitation. We're now at another
station whose name I don't recall. (It's Lonavla.)
<p>
This morning, after having read Swami Vivekananda's account of the
golden mongoose, I found the same story immediately afterwards in
the comic-book tales from the Mahabharata. But in the latter, the
pill was sugared by having the visitor be a god, and the sacrificing
family whisked off to heaven by devas. Vivekananda gives none of
this, and makes the story far more stark and real.

<h4>1740</h4> 
The country on top is like a somewhat cooler and more fertile version
of what's below: very flat, having in many places well tended crops or
rice paddies and many trees in some parts, but in others virtually bare
with just a few grazing animals, with hills behind. The further we go, the
more the hills draw back and dwindle. The sun is close to setting; it has
already gone below the hills a couple of times. I was told that just when
you feel you've been sitting for long enough you arrive in Pune. That may
well be so.
<p>
A lovely view just then of feathery seed-heads catching the setting sun.

<h4>2147</h4>

We pulled across a bridge over a double river and were in Pune. I got
off the train into a milling crowd, not quite sure of my whereabouts.
(I found later that they'd switched platforms at the last minute, so the
huge crowd had to pour across the bridge to meet the train.) But there
was Kulkarni, after I'd hesitated for a moment, with another visitor, a
professor of computer science.
<p>
We drove to the University, making a couple of stops for business on the
way. When I was installed in my room, we went out to eat, since the guest
house was not providing anything.
<p>
Unable to find a rickshaw quickly, Kulkarni decided to go on his scooter
and fetch one while the professor and I walked on. Very soon he came back
with a rickshaw, and we went in convoy towards town, where we stopped at
a restaurant "for veg lovers only". The food was OK but a trifle bland
and a bit greasy. I was very thirsty and took a Limka first but then
decided to brave the water, after being told that Pune water is
relatively unpolluted. I had sweet corn veg soup, then shares of one
hot (jal fri) and one mild (korma) vegetable dish, and bindi fry, with
a paratha, and kulfi to follow. I ate with my fingers in the authentic
fashion. The kulfi was delicious. Then we came back to the guest house.
<p>
This room has mosquito nets and a proper sit-down toilet with toilet
paper. Only soap and towel are lacking. But I think I'll be comfortable
here. There is a balcony promising a good view in the morning.
<p>
Over the town tonight there's a huge, bright full moon. Outside my
window some people are singing Christmas carols to the most
extraordinary un-carol-like rhythm.

<h4>24/12/88, 0749</h4> 

By morning, there is a feel of being in the mountains. It's
quite unlike the other places I've stayed in India. The only sounds are
bird-calls and train whistles, apart from a very faint hum of traffic.
All that can be seen in all directions is trees, some flowering in red,
white and purple. The air is not clean but has a freshness that is
surely the effect of altitude. But the same haze covers everything.
<p>
I slept quite well despite a couple of mosquitoes inside my mosquito
net; the lumps have almost entirely gone now. I lecture at 2.00 today
and take the train back to Bombay at 6.45 tomorrow. Shopping really
will be a problem! I'll have no free time today, and I can't believe
anything will be open tomorrow.

<h4>0904</h4>

I had a cup of tea and then went for a walk, which considerably sharpened
my impressions. This is good, for me to see that not all of India is like the
slums of Calcutta, or the area around Bombay airport!
<p>
Apart from a large cleared playing field of some kind, all the area is
quite thickly wooded, with many different kinds of trees. In the bottom
of the garden of the guest-house is a banyan-type tree laden with
bright red figs; little stripy squirrels in the branches called
angrily to me as I stood underneath. A few people walked around or
sat looking at the view, and I saw one runner. There is a huge variety
of birdcalls. It looks quite dry now, but I understand that in
the monsoon it is completely transformed.
<p>
Then back for breakfast. I was offered a change from the ubiquitous
omelette --- fried eggs --- but passed it up. The tea is very good.

<h4>1230</h4>

I took camera and notebook and went for a stroll. I was able to take
perhaps some of my best photos so far, though mainly of vegetation,
of which there's plenty here. I sat in the formal gardens in front
of the main University building (once the British governor's palace),
walked along roads through the trees to various departments, and then
went to the mathematics department and met some of the people there.
I was given the souvenir programme and abstracts of talks of the
Ramanujan analysis symposium they held here last year. The former
contained, as well as a life of Ramanujan, a brief history of Pune
which puts things in context a bit.

<h4>1752</h4> 

I think I'm enjoying this part of the trip best of all, largely
because of the good offices of Devadatta Kulkarni, who was responsible
for getting me here.
<p>
After lunch, which we took with a few computer scientists, one from
California (taking great pride in fending for himself and mixing
with the common people) we went back to the Maths Department for
my talk. The start was delayed because of our asking for coffee
after lunch; such an unusual request quite flummoxed the kitchen
staff! So I went on the back of Kulkarni's scooter (a very popular
means of transport here) and had a few minutes to collect my thoughts.
<p>
I was surprised by the size of the audience. This is partly explained
by the fact that, though the department is small, it has no
undergraduates, so everybody will come to such a lecture. Also there
were several computer scientists from a meeting just finished, and a
few mathematicians for a meeting about to start.
<p>
The talk went very well indeed. I went a bit overtime, and even
further in answering some of the questions that were thrown at me.
It is nice, in a department having people with  such disparate
interests and no real groups, to be able to offer a vision of an
all-embracing kind of mathematics.
<p>
Afterwards, I stayed for a while talking to several people: one who
has a nephew who is a lawyer in London; another a physicist with new
algorithms for spanning trees, graph isomorphism, etc.; two people
working on Clapham and Kleitman's paper on self-complementary degree
sequences, stuck on a point where they want help. Finally, I had a
long talk with Kulkarni in his office and walking to the canteen and
having a soft drink there.
<p>
Among other things, he's arranged a guide for me tomorrow, to take me
first to the Shiva temple and to the museum which has a fine collection
of musical instruments, and then shopping. (Surprisingly to me, they
assure me that, because it's Christmas, shops that might normally be
closed on Sunday will certainly be open!) Also we talked about
mathematics, about such metamathematical problems as career prospects
and algebraic geometers' disdain for combinatorics, about pop music,
and running, and all kinds of things.
<p>
Small interruption there. An old man just came to the door and handed
me a worn and dirty pair of knickers. He said something that sounded
like `pyjamas'. I don't understand.
<p>
Tonight (7.30) we are going out to dinner. Tomorrow morning sightseeing
(as I said - and there was much discussion of what I should buy and which
shops are the best); afternoon, more talk, then the train at 6.45. I believe
a message has been sent to Sane with my arrival time.

<h4>1925</h4> 

Vivekananda must have been a very impressive preacher. He tells
excellent stories, and his words do strike right to the heart. But
the work does have a somewhat dated look to it, especially the
physical and psychological theories he quotes. It is important to
see that this really doesn't matter.
<p>
I spent a while reading the Clapham--Kleitman paper: terrible stuff,
so hard to understand. Also thinking more about Sane's question.
We should get a larger partial spread by the following method. Let
<i>S</i> be the set of points covered. For <i>p</i> in <i>S</i>, let 
<i>a<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>p</i>) be the number of lines <i>L</i> with <i>p</i> 
in <i>L</i>, so that <i>L</i> has <i>i</i> points of S. We can assume
that <i>a<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;3 for some <i>i</i>  - 
otherwise we have a configuration
which can be covered more economically. Perhaps this works at the
next stage too.

<h4>2255</h4> 

We got down town by the same procedure as last night, that is, 
Devadatta going on his scooter to find a rickshaw and coming back
to pick us up. It was a longer journey this time, into the centre
of town through suburbs which were in no way characteristically
Indian, but could have been anywhere in the world. In town, we went
into quite a fancy Chinese and Indian restaurant (quite a common
combination here), where we sat outdoors under an awning, with trees
covered with coloured lights, and very thin Father Christmases walking
around shaking hands with everyone and occasionally handing out whistles.
We had a beer while we considered the menu, and then ordered a mixture
of Chinese and Indian dishes. The food was really well prepared, the
spicing subtle and varied, and the food much less greasy than last
night. Much good talk went with it, and I learnt much about Indian
history and culture, including the fact that I should go to the South in
December when they have a big music festival. We finished with ice cream
and coffee. The waiter couldn't believe it when we asked for black filter
coffee, so he brought us each half a cup of black coffee and half a cup
of hot milk. Hot water was requested (not by me) and came barely warm.
That place didn't understand coffee!
<p>
Two things stamped the evening as Indian. Outside, I was introduced
to Paan (sweet, I hasten to add, not tobacco) Also, a fight very
nearly developed between bus and rickshaw drivers in the main
street. We had a bit of trouble finding a rickshaw driver
prepared to go to the university at that time of night, but
succeeded at the fourth attempt.
<p>
Siting in the restaurant, I felt a greater sense of well-being
than at any other time on the trip. This town, at least, doesn't
feel too foreign to me.

<h4>25/12/88, 0730</h4>

Christmas.
<p>
My guide was supposed to come at 7.15. The sun has just risen,
and the valley is filled with hazy mist which the morning light is
just touching. The birds are full of song, and a television plays
somewhere. The air is quite cool.
<p>
What to do if he doesn't come? I'll have breakfast and then try
to find my own way to the centre of town, taking shopping as the
priority.

<h4>1422</h4>
 
And an even better day still.
<p>
The two students (Charudatta and Nauiwadekar) who'd been interested
in the Clapham-Kleitman paper came at 7.30.
<p>
We went first to the temple, on top of a big hill, with stone steps,
apparently for elephants to walk up - a comparable climb to
Whitby. The view was stunning. There was a lot of mist or haze,
out of which hills poked their heads like islands. Nearer at hand,
much of the city was visible, and in the other direction you could
see clear to the mountains.
<p>
The temple, as befits such a site, was made to be defended, with
a thick wall around which you could walk. The actual temple itself
had little to recommend it: a statue of Shiva in the main temple,
and smaller dolls in four little houses around it, including the
Sun, to whom I did special obeisance in the hope that he'll
accompany me tomorrow. We walked on further, along a tree-lined
path on the hilltop, and passed another temple and came to a
third, containing quite a splendid idol of Vishnu.
<p>
I forgot to mention that the temple also housed a small museum,
mostly devoted to portraits of the rulers of the Mahavi kingdom
that was centred here. (Originally the Prime Minister's
headquarters had been here, the King's palace somewhere else;
but Pune became the centre of power.) There were also a few
weapons, clothes, and other artifacts.
<p>
We walked back down again and took a rickshaw to a hotel for
breakfast in the south Indian style, little light steamed cakes
with spicy dip and a cup of tea. Then we went to the town museum,
which had a remarkable collection of interesting objects,
assembled by one man. There were things like lamps, combs,
cooking utensils of all kinds (for many of which the purpose was
not clear, e.g. the coconut grater), saris, game pieces, and
especially a whole room full of musical instruments - dozens
of vinas, but also sitars, sarangis, flutes, trumpets, drums, etc.
It nearly broke my heart to see them all (many with exquisite
workmanship) in very poor repair, stuck inside glass cases and
never played. But the whole museum was absolutely fascinating.
It succeeded very well by being limited in its aims and its time
period (scarcely anything earlier than 17th century).
<p>
Then we went shopping. I've succeeded in getting rid of about 2000
rupees and have about the same amount to go. It was very helpful
having the students there, especially Ms Nauiwadekar, who was
very knowledgeable on the subject of saris, and kept me out of
various traps, in addition to taking me directly to the best
shops. I bought a very nice silk sari and a couple of Punjabi
"trouser-suit" things with the strip of cloth that goes on the
shoulder. (I gather that the latest fashion is for something a
little bit different, but never mind, I got what I liked.) I also
got some silk batik scarves and a couple of suits for the boys
(this last may well be a mistake, but it used some more money up).
<p>
Then we tried handicraft shops, looking for chessmen, but were
utterly defeated in the end. The first shop had trinkets of
various kinds, but they only had one chess set, and it had been
sold. From there we went out to a huge fairground with many stalls,
but the place we were looking for wasn't yet open. Finally, we
tried an exhibition-cum-sale of crafts from Kerala; they claimed
they had everything one could possibly want except chess sets.
At that point we gave up and came back to the guest house.
<p>
It was about 12.00, well before lunchtime, and we sat down to do
battle with Clapham and Kleitman. There was a single assertion in
the proof which, they claimed, could be seen. We did finally see
it, though it took us a whole hour to get it out. The details
were quite ferociously complicated and we made several mistakes
on the way, but the students kept me on the right track for the
most part. Afterwards, we swapped addresses - Charudatta wants
to study in Britain, I promised him a QMC prospectus.
<p>
After they left, I went down looking for lunch. I hadn't ordered
any, but the chef agreed to make me some scrambled eggs. I was
eating them when Kulkarni came in. I agreed to come to the
department and find him after lunch, but then he changed the plan
and too me instead to a kind of departmental Christmas lunch in the
refectory, where I had a second tuck-in. For them it is the lull
before the storm, as they have a conference of the Indian
Mathematical Society starting tomorrow.
<p>
After lunch and a coffee in town, we went to the department.
I've written this and a few mathematical notes, and between times
we've talked some more about mathematics and related things.

<h4>1734</h4> 

It is a change, and not always easy for me to accept, that I talk
to fellow mathematicians, not as a humble student, and not as an
equal sharing in the wonderful curiosity about the world, but as
an old person with advice to give. As it was this afternoon with
Devadatta. I was trying to urge him to get a little bit into
faculty politics, so that he can influence hiring decisions and
begin to gather a group of like-minded people about him; that is
obviously quite important if he is to stay here happily. But
somehow the Indian character, so polite and respectful, brings
this out in me. I had a delightful conversation with a young chap
who works in the department and studies too. He made friends with
several American visitors, but doesn't aspire to visit them, since
he hasn't qualifications to go to America. He only recently took
a train for the first time. He is a Buddhist who feels happy that
it is the birthday of Jesus. He said several times how happy he was
to be talking to me.
<p>
I hope I've done the right thing on this trip. The feeling haunts
me that it's all an act, and everybody can see right through me,
but they're too polite to say so.
<p>
Anyway, it's certainly helped me to appreciate the difficulty of
doing mathematics in India: the non-availability of books and
papers, the difficulty caused by inefficient referees, etc. I
really must remember this experience and avoid being the cause of
such ill myself.

<h4>1843</h4> 

Final goodbyes said, waiting for the train to depart.
<p>
It should feel much more outrageous than it does, to see members
of the department working late on a Sunday, which also happens
to be Christmas Day. They were so busy that Devadatta didn't arrive
to take me to the station until 6.10. To save a bit of time, I 
rode on the back of his scooter, instead of hunting up a rickshaw.
It was quite a hairy ride; he was talking over his shoulder all the
way, and at one point said, "If you can take this ride, you could
take a year in India." We got to the station in 20 minutes. On the
platform, half the people seemed to be related to him; we met his
sister, brother-in-law, aunt, and later his uncle. I hurriedly
showed him some of my purchases, then we talked outside the train
until a few minutes before it left.
<p>
It is much grander than the one I came up on; airline-type seats,
air-conditioning. A man brought coffee round soon after
departure.

<h4>2253</h4>

And dinner brought to your seat: soup, fish and chips, bread and
butter, a cold drink, and another coffee, for slightly more than
British Rail would have charged for the two coffees.
<p>
The journey was considerably quicker than coming up, just over
three hours, due mainly to fewer stops. I was sitting next to an
elderly gentleman with whom I made conversation most of the way.
He was in many ways reactionary, but one whose positions are
clearly thought through, and not at all closed in his views; so
we discussed education, Thatcherism, the problems of Calcutta
etc., in a most amiable way. Towards the end of the journey we
napped for a while. The train didn't terminate at Dadar, so when I
realised we were there I had to jump off in a hurry.
<p>
Sharad was there waiting for me. Somehow, in the incredible
crush, we got out of the station and found ourselves a taxi; 
the traffic at that hour was much lighter, and we were back
here quite quickly.
<p>
Now I've done the bulk of my packing, and will soon go to bed;
but up early in the morning to get ready. The TIFR car comes
at 8.30. Sharad suggests leaving my luggage here tomorrow and
coming back to pick it up - probably that's the best thing.

<h4>26/12/88, 0728</h4>

So things draw on to the close. I'm up, washed,
dressed, and packed, with plenty of space in my hand baggage,
in case I actually get to the shops and get carried away. I have
somewhere between 1300 and 2000 rupees that must be spent,
the slack allowing for reconverting 400 and buying a bottle
of whisky or something.
<p>
Needless to say, the weather is absolutely perfect and has been
throughout the trip. For the first few days I found myself
biting my tongue to stop myself saying "What a beautiful day!"
to anyone who was passing by. Of course it won't be so beautiful
back in England.
<p>
I finished Swami Vivekananda on karma yoga last night on the train.
A very lovely book. The basic theme: the aim of all yoga is
non-attachment; the specific aim of karma yoga is to act, to
work, without attachment to the fruits of that action. Thus when
you do a charitable deed, you are allowed to remark on the
curious fact that you happened to be the courier who brought the
help to the person who needed it, but you should not think,
"I did a good deed." His sub-theme is "The world doesn't need us;
if we disappeared tomorrow, it would continue in the same way."
However, he gives little specific direction as to how this is to
be realised. All he says is, if you believe in God, you should
make it your habit to offer all you do to God, and this will
help prevent you claiming it for yourself; but if you don't
believe in God, it's much harder. Maybe this is one of the
important functions of God; it certainly helps make sense of
the Hindu pantheon, where they are all manifestations of the
same thing, but are designed so that different things can be
offered naturally to different Gods by different people.
<p>
Yesterday afternoon, I found time for a walk to the top of a
couple of hills on the campus. It was a lovely walk, through the
trees, and up the dry earth and rock with sisal plants. A huge
flock of birds of prey (they looked like eagles, but would you
find so many eagles together?) circled over the summit. (It was
the crows doing aerobatics outside my window now that brought
me in mind of them.) The view from the top was perhaps even better
than it had been from the temple in the morning; the mist had
cleared, and mountains were visible in all directions. However,
unlike California (to which someone had made a comparison),
houses stopped at the foot of the hills, and there was no
building on them except for the temple right at the top of one
and something similar in the further distance. The point is that
the hills rise from a flat plain with no preliminary slope, so
there's a natural dividing line.

<h4>2039</h4> 

To begin at the beginning:
<p>
I went over for breakfast at 8 o'clock, but the canteen service
was unusually slow, and I didn't get back until just after 8.30.
(There was one person straightening chairs, one wiping tables,
one putting out cups of water for customers, two changing the
menu board, several just standing round. No-one cooking.) But
anyway, by then, the car hadn't come, and neither had anyone else,
so I went up to my room. After a few minutes, Vijayakumar (who
was to be my host in the absence of Navin) showed up with the
driver. They decided to go to breakfast while we waited for Sharad.
Eventually the party was all assembled (including a student,
working on the reconstruction problem, who was coming along as
well), and we hit the road.
<p>
It was about an hour's drive, despite a good part of the road being
wide and fast. Bits were familiar: we passed the Haji Ali mosque
(which, I read, contains the tomb of the Moslem saint Haji Ali,
whose mortal remains, cast to sea, drifted up on that rock, so
his disciples built the shrine there), the Mahalakshmi temple
(dedicated to the goddess of wealth), and, skirting the hill with
the Hanging Gardens, drove along Chowpatty Beach (at the end of
which, an air balloon in the shape of Superman carrying something,
and another depicting a cake of soap, were flying), then through
the city streets, past the Gandhi memorial, the University tower,
etc., etc., and finally to Colaba.
<p>
I'd been told that the TIFR was a restricted area. That certainly
seemed true. It is guarded by a huge army base, block after block
of high-rise apartments full of soldiers. They just waved us in.
(But on the way out, a soldier searched the TIFR bus. What was
he looking for? I had some theorems in my bag; none of them had
been proved there, though I couldn't prove that.) We went up to
Navin's room after first having a cup of tea, and parked ourselves
there, talking for a while, until it was time for the lecture,
11.00 despite an earlier rumour to the contrary.
<p>
It was a fine lecture room, with boards going right round that
can be moved up and back electrically. The audience was not so
large, despite the fact that they had had more notice than for
any of the other talks I've given here, over a week in fact -
but some people are away, while others had been away and perhaps
not seen the notice. Anyway, I did quite a good job of the lecture,
better than in Essen, I think, though I sensed afterwards that
they would have liked a bit more mathematical logic.
<p>
After the lecture, we had a short tour of the Institute. It is
set in a prime location, on the seashore and I guess very near
to the very tip of Bombay. It's surrounded by lawns, flowers,
and beautiful trees. There isn't a beach; rather, the shoreline
has been built up with huge rocks, but there is a concrete path
beside it, up and down which people walk. It reminded me of
Addison's Walk. I'm sure that many theorems must get proved there.
It looks back across the bay the way we came.
<p>
After that, we went to the library, and browsed among the current
journals. This is an important activity for the people from the
University, since the TIFR takes quite a wide range of journals
which most of the universities don't get.
<p>
The whole place reeked of privilege, stuck there in the middle of
Bombay but occupying quite a different world, with uniformed
guards coming and going. Totally air-conditioned, clean toilets,
views over the garden and the ocean. One interesting pointer was
the annual report. I browsed through the mathematics section: it
told what theorems had been proved, but not who had proved them.
Also the Institute has its own neutron source in a tower in the
garden. I didn't see its foot; I expect there are many more
guards there.
<p>
Then we went down to lunch. There is an Eastern and a Western
canteen; the words describe the style of food just as well as
the geographical location. We went to the Western, and had sweet
spaghetti out of a tin, and some kind of slightly spicy stew,
with rice.
<p>
Then we went to catch the TIFR bus to town, where the best part
of the day began. And if I had had any doubts about the warmth of 
the hospitality before, they could not have lingered. My hosts
took me to the cottage industries place where we saw some carved
chess pieces, the ones with three balls carved out of a single
piece of wood. (Sometimes four, sometimes two.) The carving was
less than immaculate, the rest of the pieces simply turned and
glued on, and the price 1350/-, which seemed expensive to me;
so we reserved them and went to look elsewhere. We were headed for
the handloom place, but on the way we stumbled into a shop which
had a beautifully carved marble set complete with marble board
for only 500/-. A much, much better buy, but it blew my chance to
rid myself of unwanted rupees, so as well I bought a sandalwood
Buddha head and a couple of pieces of jewellery (tigers eye and
garnet, really dirt cheap). I still hadn't spent enough but there
was no point trying further.
<p>
We took a taxi to the art gallery. First we went to a music shop
where Sharad insisted on buying me a present, a cassette of music
by the santoor master Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, chosen by me at
his instigation. Then we went into the art gallery, where there
were some really good things. The first exhibition room made a
wonderfully relaxing impression: huge white room sculptures
scattered around, with plants dotted between. The sculptures,
mostly cast aluminium but some brass and marble, were quite good.
Most of them were called `Human mood', and some of them really
did convey moods, mostly tense or unhappy ones, surprisingly in
such a room.
<p>
The next room had two exhibition. The first consisted of some
wonderfully expressive black and white stuff. A great mixture
of textures, from fine hatching to what looked like chromatography;
biological and botanical shapes, full of mystery and suggestion.
The other was Canadian winter photography. As if to remind me what
I'm heading towards! Much as you'd expect, but a couple which
really looked more like paintings than photographs. Still, strange
to see them in the Bombay heat.
<p>
There was still more, a `gallery on the terrace', a one-man,
apparently private-enterprise affair. I gathered from comments
that he has been at it for a long time without much change in
style; but he gave me a leaflet with his artistic philosophy on
it. The pictures were mostly highly-romanticised scenes from
rural India: people camping out of doors, in a ruined temple,
mother and baby (the last entitled `Lord of her Heart'; other
titles were similar).
<p>
From there we repaired to the restaurant for a couple or beers,
a snack (bel puri, sort of puffed rice and vegetables, a perfect
vehicle for chutney), and more talk. Finally we dispersed:
Vijayakumar to his house in the TIFR (yes, you can live your
entire life isolated from the rest of India there), the student
to a market, Sharad and I back to the University by train.
<p>
That was quite a trip too. The station was immensely crowded,
I probably couldn't have found my way alone; but the train wasn't
too bad. I've certainly been more crowded in the London
Underground. We got seats easily, sat next to three guys playing
cards, some game similar to bridge but with a peculiar deal
(of course --- and one card inevitably left over). Also, I
didn't see how trumps were chosen; there didn't seem to be any
bidding.
<p>
At the station (I don't know what it was called --- it was on
the Central Railway, not the Western), we had to queue for
quite a long time for a rickshaw. Sharad tells me it's a Muslim
area --- there were many women in black, and I gather that my
beard and no moustache, like a mullah, made some impact there.
(Much earlier in the day, an old man had stroked it and indicated
his own.)
<p>
Back to the hostel, and final leave-taking. The porter found me
a taxi while Sharad went home for a minute; both arrived back
together. About a half-hour ride took me to the airport.
<p>
Then the sour note on which my stay ended.
<p>
First, the porters cheated me. (I didn't mind really; it was a
trivial amount in English terms, and helped me get rid of some
of the remaining rupees.)
<p>
Then it took me half an hour to pass immigration control. This
was the worst part of all. I queued behind a man having huge 
amounts of trouble getting his family through, to be told that
I needed a form which I had to get from `the desk'. This turned
out to mean the check-in desk. It took me a while to discover
this. Fortunately I didn't have to rejoin the check-in queue;
I found a pile of forms on an unmanned desk and helped myself.
Then I queued again. This time I was told I was in the wrong
queue and should join a longer queue at a different desk. No
reason given, but it seems I'd been in a queue for Indians only.
Most of the delay was caused by people not filling in the form
correctly; mine was OK, and when the man read `Professor of
Mathematics' he started treating me like a human being. So Dan
was right about that.
<p>
After this it was relatively painless, except for the fact that
the duty-free shops didn't accept rupees. By this time I was
well past customs and immigration, and had no intention of
spending pounds or dollars (and anyway, they proposed to cheat
me in pounds for whisky, and the handicraft prices were
extortionate), so I passed it up. I'm now carrying some hundreds
of rupees with me. All the more reason to visit India again.
<p>
I went through the security check, and finally felt secure enough
myself to start writing up the day's events. I have been doing so
ever since (about two hours now), with two breaks, for boarding
and for a meal.
<p>
No announcement about boarding was made; all of a sudden, people
stood up and formed a queue, in which I was left near to the back.
They let passengers on in blocks. When I finally got to the
aeroplane, a pleasant surprise --- they'd put me in business
class (perhaps to make amends for their computer error). Did
they do that off their own bat, or did the travel agent
brow-beat them into it? I suppose I'll never know. But I have a
good wide comfortable seat, with just one problem: it won't
stay upright, but slowly tilts back.
<p>
Takeoff was not long delayed, and soon we were over the lights
of Bombay (Colaba visible in the distance; I don't know where
to look for the University) and the ocean I'd been gazing out
over some hours earlier. Dinner came, better even than last
time --- I had vegetarian, which was good food, with pickle,
pan masala which I didn't notice until later (what's that?),
a salad, mango mousse (mmm...), and a delicious turkish-delight-
type sweet.
<p>
So far, so good.
<p>
Impressions of India --- I've written some, and it is far too
soon to give a considered account. Mainly, I guess, contrasts,
and contrasts which the people living there just don't notice,
either because they're inured to it, or because they operate
on a certain plane and only see things on that plane. Two quick
examples: the art gallery and museum form a circle surrounded
by a busy road, the restaurant facing inwards onto a beautiful
quiet green garden; and slum dwellings with their lean-tos
right outside the army base.
<p>
It's now just after 9pm Muscat time, so we must be not too far
off halfway. There is a new issue of the in-flight magazine;
I think I'll read it now.

<h4>2145 (Muscat time)</h4>

How will I survive this flight without a book to read? I finished
the in-flight magazine, sat quiet for a while, transferred money
around between my jacket pockets, and now I'm bored. The Hindi
movie has English and Arabic subtitles, but they're not very
legible. I listened to Arabic music for a while, that being the
best of what's on offer.
<p>
India has thirteen official languages not counting English. A
ten-rupee note says `ten rupees' in all these languages, but
`I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of' in English
and Hindi only.
<p>
The only ordeal left is transferring at Muscat. Several things
can go wrong. They could lose my passport, make me miss the plane,
etc. Alternatively they might forget to transfer my baggage. All
those saris and dresses down the drain, maybe. I didn't trust
the zipper on the blue bag, and put my belt around it --- this
also hopefully makes me less of a threat to security men. Then,
of course, it had to be one of the zippers on my jacket that
went; thank heavens, not the pocket containing my money,
passport and ticket. (Not yet, anyway.)
<p>
Sharad had another brilliant idea on the problem. Consider the
trick for enlarging a partial spread. Let <i>p,q</i> be on a line <i>L</i>
of the spread. If <i>p</i> lies on at least four, and q at least one,
lines not meeting the spread again, then we can do it. Now if
both lie on three, we are still there. For either they don't all
meet, which is OK, or they do, and we have a forbidden
configuration, just like the one in the <i>k</i>=3 case.
<p>
Incidentally, even if we can't do it, there is still the problem of
finding the least number of lines covering all points. This is
still interesting in the <i>k</i>=3 case, where the same sort of
argument as we're using for <i>k</i>=4 gives a covering with about (5/6)<i>r</i>
lines (compare (2/3)<i>r</i> if there's a spread).

<h4>1849 (London time)</h4>

I'm sitting on the same seat where I was so unhappy two weeks
and a day ago. This time I'm OK, apart from the general malaise
of air travel. Is it because I'm going home? Rather, I think,
because I got here within five minutes or touching down. I went
straight to the transfer desk, and didn't get put off by the
fact that there was nobody there. Very soon a man came, took my
ticket, addressed me by my name, and took me straight out to a
transfer bus which whisked me (with quite a few other passengers
who were already organised) down to the departure lounge. I think
the main difference is that he inspired trust. He wrote the
correct flight number on the pink form, for example.
<p>
The lights of Muscat, from the air, outshone any jewels. The
atmosphere is extremely clear. Looking back along the runway
after we landed, the bright light I saw was not another plane
following us, but the moon.
<p>
To confirm my good feelings, seven minutes after sitting down
here, I have my boarding card. Now I have the opposite problem:
how to kill time until departure --- an hour and a half of it.

<h4>1929</h4>

As if to prove that things can still go amiss, the security
people made me open my bags. I guess the marble chess set
wasn't transparent to their X-rays. They didn't delay me too
long, thank heavens. That's one hassle I didn't need.

<h4>2106</h4>

Now on the way: more than half an hour of the flight to Dhahran
gone. Snack done and out of the way. Magazines all read. Now
nothing but boredom until London.

<h4>27/12/88, 0643</h4>

And now arrived, an hour early, in Gatwick, with an hour and a
half to wait for the bus.
<p>
I didn't do anything on the plane except sleep and listen to
some music. The film was `Sunset': the glimpses of it I caught
didn't seem the least funny, and certainly not anything else.
I listened to the Top 40, and the Christmas Number Ones from
the Sixties with Alan `Fluff' Freeman; the classical concert
was so wonky that it was quite unbearable. Breakfast was no
great shakes: very poor pork sausage (I suppose you wouldn't
really expect quality pork sausages from Saudi Arabia) and a
dry croissant, but the rest was OK. The orange juice was packed
by the Saudi Irish Dairy, the butter was real Lurpak from Denmark.
<p>
There were two reasons why the flight went so quickly. First, we
had a following wind. Second, as a result of the end of the
Iran-Iraq war, they can now fly the direct route to the Gulf
instead of going over the Red Sea and Egypt. I wish I'd seen it
by daylight.
<p>
I had absolutely convinced myself that I'd have problems with
Customs, who would say that I had too great a value of goods.
(Just imagine if I had to try to find receipts for all those
things!) In fact it was Immigration that took the time. We
arrived at the back of a long queue. When they decided to speed
things by letting some people through the EC desks, they took the
part of the queue from right behind me! Still it wasn't too bad;
a quarter of an hour later, my bag was on the carousel when I
got down to the baggage hall (I had to sprint to catch it before
it disappeared), and then I went straight through Customs.
<p>
Now, all this time saved is simply time which has to be wasted
again before the bus comes. I'm saving phoning home until 7.00,
by which time someone might be awake. According to the timetable,
I'll be in Oxford by 10.45. Not too bad. I certainly didn't feel
like braving the trains! I have everything on a trolley, so I
can wander this floor of the terminal as I please. It is even not
too cold, so far as I can judge, 9 degrees according to the
weather report before we landed, and probably a little warmer
when I have to go out in it.

<h4>0832</h4>

One last moment of panic to end the adventure. I couldn't find
any bus stop marked where the Oxford buses pick up. I asked
various people and got conflicting answers, but finally settled
on the stop for Victoria. Then, when no Victoria coach came in
all the time I waited, I wondered whether perhaps as it was a
holiday the service wouldn't run. But it did come, less than
a minute after 8.20, even by my watch which is probably now
a bit fast. So now nothing further can go wrong.
<p>
It was dark when I arrived, but dawn came behind a cloudbank
like a looming mountain range. Now, along the M23 and M25 there
is low ground mist, and sun striking across the top of it on the
winter greens and browns.
