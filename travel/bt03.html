<h4>Bled, 21-28 June 2003</h4>

<b>21/06/2003</b>
<p>
It's years since I kept a travel diary. Why am I starting now? 
Maybe the email from Nikhil and Nidhi Singhi mentioning that 
they had read some of my diaries.
<p>
Up at 5:30, out of the house with only a banana and a glass of 
milk for breakfast. To the tube station in time to see a train 
pulling out, then a 15 minute wait for the next. I'm not in a 
hurry, unlike four American girls whose plane is an hour earlier 
than mine; they were getting quite nervous.
<p>
The first check-in desks I came to were Austrian Airlines, 
and the queues not too long, so I was able to take myself to 
Wetherspoons for a more substantial breakfast before going to 
the gate. The bookshops had huge piles of the new Harry Potter 
book, and didn't seem to be shifting many. I did buy myself 
three books for a fiver each: I will have a long wait at Vienna 
airport on the way home.
<p>
The plane left on time, taking off to the east and flying 
over Richmond and Wimbledon, then past central London with 
fine views, and down the Thames estuary: I could see many 
places I've walked, including the horrible Mucking Marshes, 
and Canvey Island. After that, there were just enough clouds 
that visibility wasn't good for a while, so I did most of the 
Times crossword. Over Austria, large fields divided into 
multicoloured strips, and the lake and marshes south of the 
airport.
<p>
Through another security check in Vienna airport, then to 
a pair of gates downstairs from which you go by bus to the 
plane. A big crowd of people going through gate 18 to Prague, 
but only a handful of us for Ljubljana.
<p>
The check-in girl in London had thought that 12D was an 
aisle seat, but on the small Adria (Slovene airlines) plane, 
it was actually the window seat in the last row. Too cloudy 
for much of even what view wasn't blocked by the wing until 
approaching Ljubljana, in a valley that seemed too narrow and
steep-sided for an airport, with a very winding river.
<p>
I had expected immigration formalities something like those 
in Budapest or Prague, but there was no form to fill in and 
no delay. With the flight ten minutes early, there was no 
one waiting for me (just someone from a completely different 
conference), so I changed some pounds into tolars at the 
automatic change machine and waited patiently.
<p>
After fifteen minutes or so, a woman from the agency turned 
up for me. She apologised for her lateness and blamed the 
traffic. (I saw later that there was roadbuilding and 
single-lane traffic.) I got into the car and off we went. 
She seemed a bit surprised that I had been in Bled thirty-some 
years ago.
<p>
We were driving round a roundabout when her phone rang. 
After a brief conversation she said "Are you Polish?", 
which I denied; she continued round the roundabout and 
headed back to the airport. It seemed that three Poles at
a medical conference organised by a different group but 
sharing facilities had shown up needing transport. It is 
a bit hard to get used to the fact that the academic 
organisers, the conference organisers, and the hotel 
management are separate and money and vouchers have to 
circulate. I have no vouchers . . .
<p>
A second time we were off, up a valley between the steep 
tumbled mountains, clouds, sun, warm air, dark green high 
corn in plots by the roadside. At one point, a small plane 
was taking off towing a glider - lots of good thermals
today, I expect; a large bird of prey also using them (from 
a glimpse, it seemed black and white with wide wings curved 
in front).
<p>
Finally into Bled. A glimpse of the lake, with the old 
buildings on the clifftop that I remember, before we turned 
off to stop at the hotel. After checking in, a shower, 
followed by a beer (the one word of Slovenian I remember 
from last time is "pivo") and a packet of peanuts from the 
minibar, while I finished the crossword (not something I 
can usually do unaided!)
<p>
What else to do then but walk round the lake? A gorgeously 
beautiful path, full of views and surprises. The lake itself 
under wooded hills, steep cliffs rising behind to tops 
shrouded in the only clouds in the sky. The water green
and full of light, with shoals of fish and mossy submerged 
posts. Yellow and white waterlilies in flower, the water so 
clear that their stems are clearly visible. Swimmers, boats, 
and ducks (some with ducklings) on the lake. Views constantly 
changing, from mouldering masonry, to deserted alpine meadows, 
to crowded tourist beaches with accents from all over Europe 
and beyond, to formal gardens in the town. The bells of the 
church on the island resound over the water while the castle 
sits sits smugly on its cliff behind.
<p>
Many walkers, cyclists, joggers, and rollerbladers on the 
path; the last group often with children (carrying them, 
playing tag with them, or pushing them in pushchairs).
<p>
The white tourist train went past, followed by the rumble 
of a real train out of sight somewhere.
<p>
After a while, bored with the path, I turned onto a forest 
trail up the hill. It went round the back of the castle, and 
then descended on a stepped switchback (made for the benefit 
of attackers, one presumes). The air in the woods was full of 
birdsong and large but slow-moving mosquitoes.
<p>
Back in town, I bought, wrote and posted postcards, then 
went back to the hotel (where a conference poster is now 
prominently displayed).
<p>
From the hotel guide:
<blockquote>
"Values can be stored at the Reception, suits have their own safes."
</blockquote>
<p>
They also provide "face clotches" free of charge!
<p>
When I rounded the corner of the hotel on my way out to look 
for dinner, I was met with a stunning sight. Right behind 
the castle was a cloud backlit by the sun, with evening rays 
spreading out in all directions.
<p>
I was so captivated by the sight that I sat in a roadside 
restaurant and ate watching the spectacle while the light 
faded. The colours turned peach and slate (this sounds 
contrived but isn't), while a duo played oldies on keyboard 
and guitar in the restaurant across the road while a couple of
senior citizens danced with skill and obvious enjoyment, and 
huge ants scurried to and fro. When the colours had faded, 
I had finished a remarkably good meal, and went home to bed.
<p>
<b>22/06/2003</b>
<p>
I was woken at 5:30 by the minibar fridge switching on: a very soft noise,
but I wake convinced that it is the alarm and I have to get up and catch a
plane. (Yesterday I woke up before the alarm, set for 5:30 but in a different
time zone.) Memory of where I am returned and I turned over and slept again.
<p>
It was overcast when I got up, but the clouds were lifting. I sat at the
sunny end of the terrace and had an excellent breakfast in the hotel, after
which I sat on the lake shore for a while, listening to the bells from the
town church. They ring very rhythmically, with simple, slowly-changing
melodic patterns, almost like something by Philip Glass.
<p>
Scullers were rowing up and down a straight course, and a small convoy of
boats returned from the island. Small birds skimmed low over the water
catching insects, some hitting the surface; an occasional fish jumped.
<p>
The clouds drifted up and dispersed and the sun gained strength. I walked to
the castle a different way (up through the old town, with fine
old middle-European buildings, some in poor repair) and back behind the
church. By the time I went running, the sun had burned the clouds back to
yesterday's level, and it was quite hot. I ran round the lake in half an hour.
<p>
Back at the hotel, registration had started, and so I picked up my pack
before going for a shower. I went out to lunch in the pizza restaurant in the
shopping centre in quite a big group. The pizzas were so big that staying
awake in the afternoon session was a struggle.
<p>
(Maybe there was more to it than that. With some difficulty I have been
relaxing more in the last day, less inclined to leap up and be busy. After
the last talk I was good for nothing but a nap.)
<p>
When I finally emerged at about 8:30 and went out of the hotel, I met another
stunning view, The clouds had cleared completely, and the distant mountains
were in clear view. The cone of Triglav stood aloof from a tumbled range with
dramatic overhangs. They were bathed in light and casting long shadows in the
haze, while the lake and the hills behind it were in shade. (A girl came by
and tried to take a flash photo of the castle.) I had an ice-cream and
watched the gold slowly replaced with blue-grey, and then went home.
<p>
<b>23/06/2003</b>
<p>
I didn't sleep very well - perhaps I went to bed too early, or perhaps it's
something else, since I ached all over. This morning the sun was shining, but
breakfast was indoors, and the air-conditioning set quite cool.
<p>
The ache made concentrating on the lectures quite difficult: a pity since
they included two of my co-authors. At coffee time I met another co-author
for the first time, Dejan Delic, who is looking for countable groups with all
subgroups homogeneous (there can't be too many of these, I think.)
<p>
The high peaks were in full sunlight and dramatically pale compared to the
nearer wooded slopes. Clearly the white limestone was a perfect canvas for
the setting sun to paint on yesterday.
<p>
I skipped lunch to lie down. Unfortunately my room hadn't been done so I read
my email instead. Some trouble connecting: Putty stopped with an incorrect
checksum, Netscape didn't seem to have Java installed. Fortunately Internet
Explorer did the job. Lots of mail, most of which I brutally deleted. After
that I was able to lie down for a little while at least.
<p>
As the day wore on, the ache subsided, and the clouds came over. After the
talks, I ran round the lake with Richard Nowakowski. It was quite a bit
cooler and very humid. Though I creaked a bit starting out, I soon fell into
a good rhythm. Richard had to stop and walk several times, and by the end the
pace was much below what I was capable of; yet the time was 33 minutes, quite
respectable.
<p>
After showering, he and I both arrived at dinner dripping sweat. I ate with
Cheryl and John; she will introduce me tomorrow. By the time dinner was over.
it was raining. I worked for a while and went to bed.
<p>
<b>24/06/2003</b>
<p>
The aches plagued me all night and kept me awake; it was very hard to get
comfortable. A hot shower helped a bit.
<p>
The morning was sunny, the faces of the distant mountains bright white - no
wonder they take the colours of sunset so beautifully. I couldn't settle to
anything before my talk, but once the adrenaline got flowing I was fine.
Someone in the audience suggested delta-matroids as the right concept for
permutation group bases: I don't think so but I will check.
<p>
Bojan Mohar made an interesting suggestion. As well as minimal base size, he
has considered the smallest cardinality of a set of points with the property
that the meet of the orbit partitions of their stabilisers is trivial. Of
course such a set is a base, so this number is not smaller than the minimal
base size. He has examples (automorphism groups of Paley graphs of prime
order) where the base size is 2 but his invariant is about log n.
<p>
During the morning talks I remembered that I have seen something like this
before! Laci Babai bounded the order of a uniprimitive permutation group by
bounding the base size, and if I am not mistaken he did this by bounding the
"separation number" in Bojan's sense.
<p>
Also, the definitions of irredundant, minimal and (probably) greedy base
extend to separating sets in this sense. Lots of interesting stuff to work on
here!
<p>
I walked round the lake, stopping for a pizza at the beach near the outflow
(and of course it was far too much). The breeze had got up; waterlilies and
swans bounced up and down on the chop.
<p>
In the late afternoon, a cracker storm blew up. The power flickered, and the
computers in the conference office lost their internet connections. From the
back of the lecture room, the rain sounded really heavy. But by dinnertime,
it had stopped, and the sun shone from under the cloud cover.
<p>
Dinner was traditional Slovenian food, by candlelight with zither music
(those standards that you know well but can't put a name to). Of course this
took longer, and the problem session was somewhat delayed. It was very
delicious but again, of course, there was far more to eat than I needed; I
should have skipped it.
<p>
I presented one problem at the session: finding the smallest maximal clique
in the graph on the symmetric group, two permutations adjacent if they agree
in fewer than s points. Most of the other problems had little appeal to me,
apart from the characterisation of isometric subgraphs of Johnson graphs..
<p>
The aches seem to be easing a bit. Not before time!
<p>
<b>25/06/2003</b>
<p>
A glorious morning; early cloud cleared quickly and the views are bright
after the storm. After breakfast I took a small walk to the town, looking for
the bus station, which I didn't find (I've been told it exists but it's not
on any map).
<p>
Morning talks about geometric things: Branko Grunbaum trying to reverse 2500
years of history by giving a definition of a polyhedron; Victor Chepoi with
some very complicated results on median graphs and generalisations; and the
regular Cayley maps team of Tom Tucker and Marston Conder with lots of fine
detail about finite abelian groups.
<p>
I didn't need a big lunch before the excursion, so just had peanuts and juice
from the minibar.
<p>
The excursion was both exhilarating and frustrating. We went by bus, first
along the highway towards the tunnel under the Karavanke mountains to
Austria, then just past the city of Jesenice with its vast and mostly
derelict ironworks rusting away. We turned off onto a smaller road, where
Tomaz Pisanski told the story of the day Slovenia declared independence,
which occurred during the conference 12 years ago, and whose anniversary today
is.
<p>
Then we turned onto the road over the Vrsic pass. This road, built by Russian
prisoners during the first world war, in an area where a vast battle with a
million victims (later written about by Ernest Hemingway), boasts 24 hairpin
bends on the way up, and 26 on the way down on the other side.
<p>
We stopped first for five minutes at the Russian chapel built by the
prisoners. It was of course locked. By mutual consent, Richard and I set off
for a short walk, counting on the fact that five minutes would be ten. We saw
some very nice orchids, and were back just as the last stragglers were
boarding the bus.
<p>
Climbing higher, there were lovely wildflowers by the roadside, and
spectacular views of the limestone mountains, including one with a window and
the face of a girl pointed out by the guide. No stop at the top, but down
with lovely views of the Soca valley, then down the valley a little way to
the museum.
<p>
Why did they have to take us to see mountains and rivers in a museum when the
real ones are all around? Most of the picture show was wasted on me, but
there was a nice video installation filmed under water and shown on eight
slightly time-shifted screens. Of course they dragged us away long before it
finished! Also we heard the legend of Zlatorog, the golden-horned mountain
goat who features on the beer bottles.
<p>
After the museum tour, it came on to rain, and so we were spared seeing
wildflowers in a museum (we actually got to see the real thing at another
short stop on the way back). The final stop, scheduled for 40 minutes, was at
an alpine hut for a drink. Richard and I agreed to have a quick drink and
then a short walk. Of course, the drink was anything but quick, with so many
people all being indecisive; we set off ten minutes before advertised
departure time but once again gambled successfully on a considerable delay.
<p>
We got to the top of the hill and were faced with a hallucinogenic view of
these huge masses of limestone. We walked along the ridge for a while
drinking in the view (including a closer look at the girl's face) and then
decided to take a trail leading to the base of the rock face. We didn't quite
make it, and then had to run down, but how much better mountains look this
way than through a bus window!
<p>
I forgot to say that we saw a large bird of prey going into a dive into a
small clump of pine trees.
<p>
Another impression from the day: the faint blue colour of the water in the
rivers, both Sava and Soca.
<p>
(The placenames are taken from a very small scale map - I hope they are
right!)
<p>
On the way back, Pavol Hell gave me enough information to introduce him
tomorrow morning.
<p>
Back at 8:20 (much later than advertised), and so to dinner and bed.
<p>
<b>26/06/2003</b>
<p>
The aches having almost gone, I was able to sleep in comfort. No problems
with the session I chaired; I was able to make a small connection between us
(we both left our home countries in the same year to study on the other side
of the world, though for different reasons). Nice talk too.
<p>
At coffee, Misha Klin told me about a student of his who has a list of
vertex-transitive association schemes on up to 23 vertices; he will encourage
him to make this information available.
<p>
I skipped lunch to go for a run. Round the lake, but I decided to include the
castle hill. The first turning after the inflow just led down to the road
again. The second would have done the same thing but I noticed I was on a
familiar path and backtracked; a very steep pinch took me to the top, and I
went back through the town. The hills stopped me a bit but otherwise it was
very easy. The birdsong in the forest was nice.
<p>
In the afternoon coffee break, Anthony Bonato proposed me a problem which I
was able to solve, not in the way he expected. The problem concerned a model
for the Internet graph (trendy stuff now), and I showed that the infinite
limit of his model is almost surely the countable random graph.
<p>
During the afternoon, it clouded over, and in the last session there was a
cracker thunderstorm. Dejan Delic had just been introduced when the power
went off, leaving only the emergency lights. He had to wait nearly ten
minutes before he could start. It was still raining heavily when we assembled
to wait for the bus to the dinner, so no outdoor conference photo.
<p>
For dinner they took us by bus to Radovljica to a fine old restaurant. We
didn't seem to have climbed, so when we got out of the bus I was surprised to
find myself in a high place above the Sava valley. The storm had cleared and
the sun come out, but the valley was full of wisps of cloud backlit by the
sun, making a very fine display as they wended through the pine forests on
the hillsides.
<p>
The dinner began with a wine tasting; five bottles of wine between (in our
case) half a dozen people, accompanied by very nice sausage en croute and
cooked ham. Then we were shepherded upstairs for a dinner which involved two
soups, three kinds of meat (beef, lamb, and venison which Tomo says is
actually elk and was very delicious), and infinitely many desserts.
<p>
Bojan invited me to propose a toast to the conference, which I was delighted
to do. Afterwards, during the meal, he and I discussed having a European
conference along the lines of the national conferences - unlike the current
Euroconferences, everyone would be welcome, and all would be allowed to talk.
I hope this goes further.
<p>
At a certain point in the evening, Marston Conder proposed a game in which
someone sings a song and then nominates another nationality to follow. This
produced some extraordinary performances by the Korean and French teams.
Inevitably I got called in to be the English representative; since Cheryl had
already been the Australian, I thought it would have been unsporting to play
that card. I sang a verse and chorus of "Yellow Submarine", which seemed to
hit the spot OK.
<p>
And so home and to bed.
<p>
<b>27/06/2003</b>
<p>
Mathematicians were unsurprisingly thin on the ground at breakfast. By 8am,
apart from me there were only Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi (who swapped with
Richard Nowakowski to give the first talk, as he is leaving early), Tomo and
his wife. Richard arrived as I was leaving. I give full marks to the Slovene
wine; no ill effects at all this morning, though I wasn't very hungry, for a
different reason!
<p>
After breakfast, I went down to the tourist place and bought a 1:30000 map,
with a view to a walk in the afternoon (weather permitting). But plans were
changed by the announcement that there would be a small "survivors' party" -
the conference would treat everyone to an ice-cream in the lakeside
restaurant.
<p>
After the talks (both Richard and Bojan said things that made me prick up my
ears), Tomo showed some conference pictures - now digital photography has
changed all this; after the red eyes have been fixed they will all be put on
the web! And then it was over.
<p>
Rather than lunch, I took a walk, determined to get at least some use out of
my new map. I went up the road behind the hotel, round behind the hill with
the ski lift, and back in front of the hill. A sizeable cliff; and two
cyclamens in flower on the path. Wild strawberries far from fruiting.
<p>
Back at the hotel, we set off for the restaurant. It was now beginning to
cloud up; by the time we sat down, the thunder had begun (I took the
precaution of sitting under an umbrella), and soon the rain had started in
earnest. We crowded in, and neither I nor my very fruity banana split got wet.
<p>
After two hours, some of us decided to brave it and go back to the hotel. Of
course, that did the trick; by the time we got back, the rain had shopped,
the sky was clearing, and rags of cloud were draped over the forested hills
around the lake.
<p>
A shock awaited me when I got to my room. The chambermaid had left the window
open, and there were floods of water on the desk and everything on it. The
Best Western brochures, the Bled brochure, and the telephone notepad were a
complete write-off. Anthony Bonato's two papers were soaked, but fortunately
they had sheltered my tote bag; and in the bag, the notepads had sheltered
the rally crucial items (tickets, passport and organiser). I told the front
desk, and a woman came to mop it up while I spread papers out to dry.
<p>
While waiting, I went down to the terrace to try to prove what I told Bojan
at the lake, that the line graph of a complete graph has separation number
one more than its rigidity number. The waiter came so I had a beer; the sun
came out so I looked at the shining clouds; and the English oldies came to
have tea. They were playing watered-down versions of slushy sixties hits.
Eventually, when I had sorted it out - it turns out that I am correct if the
order is not divisible by 3, otherwise the two parameters are equal - I
couldn't stand it any more, and went away.
<p>
Back in my room, the wet paper was drying out satisfactorily. I had a sudden
panic when I couldn't find my keys. Most likely I left home without them. I
typed up my musings to send to Bojan. 
<p>
After dinner, Richard and I decided on one final walk around the lake. Once
underway, we decided to vary it by climbing up to the castle, and then walked
along a forest trail to the bathing place. The light in the forest was dim,
the pine needles soft underfoot, and the birdsong loud in the twilight.
<p>
When we got down, the mountains behind the lake were several shades of pale
blue under a soft lilac sky. The lights of Bled reflected in the water, and
hear at hand, a boat was tied up. By way of contrast, about a dozen
headbangers were in the car park, throwing themselves around frenziedly to
loud thrash music.
<p>
At this point it began to rain, and we were quite damp by the time we got
back to the hotel, though this light shower was nothing compared to this
afternoon's effort.
<p>
<b>28/06/2003</b>
<p>
A day with lots of waiting around. I had breakfasted and 
checked out an hour and a half before the airport transport 
came. Richard and I passed the time chatting. The conference 
moving in was of German investment consultants. They were mostly 
in suits or at least shirt and tie, except for one who was
conspicuously dressed down in pressed jeans and immaculate 
T-shirt; Richard conjectured that he was the boss.
<p>
Our driver was the same one who had brought me from the 
airport a week ago. The journey was fast and smooth, with 
several interesting things to see: lots of blue chicory 
flowers by the roadside; a hawk fluttering and then going
into a vertical dive onto its prey with barely a pause 
before hitting the ground; an old castle on a hilltop; 
a farm with a big herd of ostriches; a large bird hovering 
over the airport (awaiting clearance for landing?).
<p>
At the airport, check-in, security and passport control 
were finished in record time. Even the duty-free shop 
didn't detain us for long, though I did buy a bottle of 
merlot (hopefully similar to the one at the dinner). 
<p>
So there was nothing for it but t have a coffee and talk 
the time away until Richard's flight to Munich was called. 
He goes on to Manchester (heading for Bangor); curiously, 
the very next plane was direct to Manchester (presumably
a charter). We said goodbye for a little over 24 hours at 
the departure gate.
<p>
It seems that the only commercial flights from this airport 
are international (though many of the destinations would 
have been internal before Yugoslavia fell apart), and most 
of the airlines flying here belong to former Yugoslav
republics. I wonder how the logistics of dividing this up 
were worked out.
<p>
At a booth in the departure lounge, you can charge your 
mobile phone free of charge. (The words are not the same 
in Slovenian.) It took me a long time, and a mental 
dissociation, to notice that the large H of the duty-free 
shop's logo concealed a smaller G.
<p>
The flight to Vienna was quick and uneventful. I was in 
the same seat as before, right at the back; this time on 
the side away from the mountains, so there was little to 
see but cloud formations and blue fading into blue. The
wind must have changed; our approach to Vienna was quite 
different, over mixed urban and rural landscape, with 
plotted fields sandwiched among highrise estates and huge 
railway yards.
<p>
In the airport, the long wait began. Nowhere to sit in the 
gate area, so I had to resort to a seat in a transit 
corridor (opposite a mural saying "More convenience for our 
passengers") for the four-hour wait.
<p>
After an hour, I needed a walk, so explored the terminal. 
Not a long job; five minutes took me to every nook. In 
desperation I bought a Guardian from one of the four shops, 
for the sake of the crossword. Browsing it, I find a
reader reporting seeing the first second-hand copy of the 
latest Harry Potter book. In an hour and a half, I did all 
but two clues of the prize crossword, and the organiser got 
the last two for me, one being triply clued.
<p>
Then I returned to the gate area, only slightly less frenzied 
(eight long-haul gates and only twenty seats!). Two very big 
flights, to Montreal and Toronto, were leaving at the same 
time as ours.
<p>
Suddenly a queue formed, and moved quite fast, and we went 
through security and immigration and into the gate lounge for 
another wait. Again suddenly another queue formed and we were 
on the plane. 
<p>
Take-off retraced our path over the same landmarks. The cloud 
base was quite high, and we had good views of the Danube in 
its two channels, and a new road crossing high viaducts heading 
into the mountains, before the whiteness surrounded us. But 
soon we reached a long break in the cloud, and had fine views 
of the mixture of forest, farms, and villages of Austria and 
southern Germany.
<p>
After that the cloud gave only intermittent views. Once there 
were two planes below us: one near the ground, probably landing 
in Frankfurt; the other, crab-wise, crossing our path just 
below us.
<p>
My neighbour was an 18-year-old Sarajevo boy on his third 
trip to England (his favourite country) though his first solo. 
I gave him some help with his landing card, and was pleased 
when we had a splendid view of central London.
<p>
The immigration queue was short when we arrived, but 
lengthened alarmingly rapidly behind us. Less than half an 
hour from touchdown I was on the Piccadilly line.
<p>
<h4>Tehran, 8-21 August 2003</h4>
<p>
<b>8/8/2003</b>
<p>
Quite a busy day. I saw both Robert and Abi, made a web page for the London
Algebra Colloquium, and began the process of filling next semester's
programme; at 4pm the DTRS external representation document beta release was
frozen and I got a printout to take with me. Then home to change and collect
my bag, and off to the airport.
<p>
Terminal 4 is one of my least favourite places. The travel agent's letter had
said I should get there 2 hours and 30 minutes before departure. With my
usual caution it was nearer 3 hours. I stood for an hour while other flights
were given check-in areas but ours was simply told to "Please wait". Finally
I asked one of the BA employees, who told me that check-in would be in zone A
and I should join the queue.
<p>
I stood in the queue for 15 minutes - a frighteningly long queue, with no
perceptible movement. Then another BA employee came by and asked the people
in front of me where they were going. They said "Luanda". "You should not be
in the queue; please wait." Then I told my destination, expecting the same
response. Instead I was taken through a rope barrier to a much shorter queue,
and ten minutes later I was checked in. Through security, I had time for a
sandwich and a visit to the bathroom, and then with an hour to go we had a
gate number (the long trek to gate 19) and I went and sat and waited.
<p>
Right on time we were called to board. But instead of boarding the aircraft
on the stand, we were directed to the ground and taken on buses to a far
corner of the airport to find our Airbus. All aboard, the captain announced a
five minute delay while the final catering supplies were delivered. This
lengthened to an hour before we were finally off.
<p>
Now somewhere over Europe with dark below and a nearly full moon keeping me
company outside my window, I can't sleep until the dinner has come, so I can
think about my first talk (three hours after touchdown) and write this. Why am
I going to Iran? This is a country which has been in the news twice recently,
once for the murder of someone for taking a photograph, and once because of a
refugee who face execution for the "crime" of bigamy if he returns there.
Moreover, I (in common with the other westerners at the conference) have
received three emailed death threats. This is all on the basis of religion,
supposedly. Do they really want me to believe that a religion which
attributes to its God the properties of mercy and compassion demands such
things?
<p>
The captain tells us that Tehran time is three and a half hours ahead of
London - just to make setting my watch more difficult! The Psion confirms
that, the clever little thing.
<p>
<b>9/8/2003</b>
<p>
Dinner over, lights too bright to sleep. Flight half over. A bizarre movie
which seems to be mainly about kids in orange overalls digging holes in the
desert - it's hard to discern the plot without the sound. There was an
altercation just now between my neighbour, who was sleeping with his seat
right back, and the person behind him who was obviously having some difficulty
eating his dinner.
<p>
Eventually the film ended, and they showed the flight data, according to
which we were just crossing the Black Sea coast. I looked out and, sure
enough, a large sprawl of lights ending abruptly in a pool of blackness.
Later, we crossed the southern coast, with one much smaller town visible, and
then little but the occasional town. I dozed for a while, and then the cabin
crew came round with drinks. It was still dark out my window, but on the
other side, dawn had broken, with a line of lighter above the darker earth
(that must have been the Caspian Sea), and orange sky shading into blue.
<p>
Just before landing, the plane turned to the north and west and I had a view
of the city and the spectacular mountains behind. Tehran is like no other
city I have seen; like every big city it has a characteristic appearance, but
the apartment blocks are cardboard coloured and the earth is sand-coloured,
so I was inexorably reminded of toytown. We were on the ground, to the
minute, at the time they had told us in London.
<p>
Getting through the airport was a bit slow - the customs officer dealing with
the queue I was in had to keep going away with difficult customers - but
eventually I was through, met the contact from IPM, and was on the way.
<p>
Iranian traffic is as chaotic as Indian, but much more homogeneous: instead
of having pedestrians, bullock-carts, cars, buses and trucks sharing the
road, it seemed to be almost entirely medium-sized white cars. The traffic
was quite ferocious (it was the morning rush hour), but gradually we got past
the worst of it and came to the IPM guesthouse in a pleasant suburb very near
the mountains. I dumped my bag, had a very quick shower, changed my clothes,
and just had time for a quick breakfast (including carrot jam) before we had
to go to catch the bus.
<p>
This is perhaps the most friendly place I  have ever been. And, a good sign,
during the day I discovered that young people are not shy in coming up and
asking me questions. Moreover, they look after us very well: lots of
computers for the visitors in a special room where we can work, tea and
coffee and Iranian Danish pastries (nicer than the Danish ones!); a "Daily
News" which began with a feature on my mathematical ancestry and also
included the recipe for the rice dish we had for lunch (Bagali polow).
<p>
My talk went well despite the tendency for my eyelids to droop. And later,
both Sam Hedayat and Willem Haemers brilliantly set up stuff for me to talk
about later.
<p>
The IPM itself is in beautiful grounds where the Queen used to live before
the revolution. (I am told that Reza Khosrovshahi has her office!) Huge
mature trees and rose gardens; a building up the hill for the postdocs with
good facilities; what seems to be an extensive library. One of the most
spectacular mathematics institutes I have been to.
<p>
After the day's events most people went back to the guesthouse for a rest,
but I decided to keep going until bedtime. I read my email and then talked
to the organisers until it was time for the reception.
<p>
Several times I have been reminded of Pasadena (both Charles Johnson and Rick
Wilson have mentioned it too). The grounds, not unlike the Huntington; the
bare mountains very close; trees full of noisy parrots. At the reception in
the garden we had some very good fruit (melons, fig peaches, grapes and
cherries) and desserts (ice cream and an Iranian speciality). And so home to
bed.
<p>
<b>10/8/2003</b>
<p>
I slept well and woke up just before breakfast, in time to start writing
notes about orbits of PSL(2,<i>q)</i> on <i>k</i>-sets, which I had 
discussed with the
young guys (Tayfeh-Rezaie, Maimani and Omidi). Then off to the IPM in a bit 
of a rush. Interesting talks which I won't report in detail. After lunch a 
few of us went to the park at Niyavaran (opposite the IPM) which used to be 
part of the Shah's private palace, before we went off on the tour to his 
complex of more public palaces (to one of which Sam Hedayat had been, to 
be presented with a University medal).
<p>
The main palace was grand but not overwhelmingly so, done in the French style
but the French would have done it better. The two things to catch the eye
were the huge and absolutely priceless carpets on the floors, and some
paintings of hunting and war scenes in traditional style around the big
skylight upstairs. The pictures tried to speak to me but I couldn't
understand what they were saying. A hunter had just shot a lion in the
process of devouring a deer. The lion and the deer were in the position of
sexual intercourse, and while the lion looked disdainfully at the hunter, the
deer looked at him with real fear.
<p>
The smaller palace boasted a mirrored room, all the tiny mirror segments
having been set by hand and reflecting the light of the chandelier at odd
angles. It reminded me a bit of the Jain temple in Calcutta.
<p>
A stop at a teashop, then back to the guesthouse for the customary rest.
<p>
The sense of oppression, which had lifted, came back with two stories I heard
today. While wearing a T-shirt might be acceptable, shorts most definitely
would not; a student was thrown out of university for going running in
shorts. Richard Bean was hauled off by the police at dawn because a neighbour
had reported that there was a foreigner living there. What absurd things are
criminalised by this regime?
<p>
Gradually we have become aware that we are followed round by security men.
Some people think they are watching us; I think it is more likely that the
death threats were taken seriously and they are guarding us.
<p>
Working out Moebius functions of some groups for the k-orbit problem gave me
one surprise. After finding a very nice argument for dihedral groups, I did
the calculations for A<sub>4</sub>, S<sub>4</sub> and A<sub>5</sub>; if I am 
not mistaken, the answer is the group order divided by 3, 2, 1 respectively. 
These numbers have an obvious resonance in connection with the Lie algebras 
E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub> and E<sub>8</sub>.
Probably the explanation is well known to some people. But it can't be a
general phenomenon for reflection groups since nothing analogous holds for
the cyclic and dihedral groups.
<p>
In the evening, we went to the Jamshidieh park, a super place: on the slope
of the mountain, the landscaping slowly moving up the slope. The bottom
section had shone paths, lanes among the gardens and avenues of trees,
stepping stones across ponds. Each higher level has a restaurant featuring
some traditional Iranian cuisine - Turkmen, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, etc. We
went to the Kurdish restaurant. Like the others, half of the walls were
living rock, and it had many interconnecting rooms and terraces, some with
tables, some with divans, and with appropriate decor (an old astrolabe in
the Azerbaijani section).
<p>
Further up, the steps were cut out of the rock and not always very well
defines. The sprinklers were on; apart from watering us several times, they
made the rock quite slippery.
<p>
We sat on the front terrace above the restaurant. There was a splendid view
over Tehran, and as the darkness fell, the smog became less evident, and the
lights came on. A nearly full moon rose, and later Mars (a week from its
closest approach to the earth, fiery red - surely the planet I saw from the
plane) made its appearance.
<p>
A good meal - juice, seedy bread and salads, lamb cooked in several different
ways, alcohol-free beer (with added vitamins) to drink. Lots of good talk
too: I learned a lot about the recent history of Iran, and its relations with
the USA.
<p>
Then back down to the car park to catch the bus. The wet rocks made even
Willem remark that he was glad the beer had been alcohol-free!
<p>
<b>11/8/2003</b>
<p>
I meant to be up early - Mandana had taken my millennium poem very seriously,
and had asked to read some more, so I selected a few and put them on the web.
But since I overslept, I only just had time to do this and have a rushed
breakfast before time for the coach.
<p>
Mandana showed me a book of poetry by Hafiz which belongs to Kathy Wilson. I
opened it at random and found on one page a poem urging us to live in the
present, and on the facing page a poem in code. This is someone I must read!
<p>
At least one talk contained material familiar to me: Dean Crnkovic talked
about symmetric (36,15,6), (40,13,4) and (45,12,3) designs admitting Sp(4,3).
I couldn't restrain myself from telling him afterwards that much more is
known.
<p>
After lunch, a remarkable talk by Afra Zomorodian, justifying why a
computational topologist is at a combinatorics meeting. (He uses
"persistence" and some computational tricks to detect Betti numbers from
simplicial approximations.) Then Willem Haemers gave us a nice theorem
(Bruck-Ryser-Chowla in the singular case, from which various new nonexistence
results follow.
<p>
A little competition was run, open to students, to discover the middle names
of the invited speakers. The winner adopted the simplest strategy - she asked
us! The prize was having her picture taken with the six of us.
<p>
Apart from parrots, the only birds in evidence are grey crows with black
heads and wings, who strike dignified poses.
<p>
In the evening, after only a short rest, we were off in the bus again, to
Reza Khosrovshahi's apartment for a delightful party. Reza's wife is a
painter, and a very good one - I had wondered about asking whether any of the
paintings were for sale, and had decided it was impracticable, but Kathy
Wilson went ahead and bought one. His son plays the daf (frame drum) very
well, and gave us a short performance after Rick had played the flute (and
Kathy sang) and before yours truly strummed a rather battered steel-string
guitar. The meal was superb, and there was plenty to drink. Such a good party
that we didn't get home until 1pm.
<p>
<b>12/8 2003</b>
<p>
I only just managed to get up, wash some clothes, and have a rushed breakfast
before it was time to catch the bus.
<p>
Richard Brualdi gave us a packed but beautiful talk, generalising the RSK
correspondence and Bruhat order from the set of permutations to the set of
matrices with prescribed row and column sums.
<p>
I talked about the DTRS project and, I think, raised some interest, but there
was no time for discussion; an extra talk (by Ebad Mahmoodian) had been
slotted in before lunch (in the garden today) and then off to the carpet
museum.
<p>
That has to be one of the great sights of Tehran. Among other things, they
have a reproduction of the oldest known carpet (2500 years old, found frozen
inside a block of ice by a Russian archaeologist), and we had a chance to
watch the museum's resident carpet weaver (who made this reproduction) at
work and ask him questions. There were many really beautiful traditional
carpets, and also some oddities: a carpet featuring famous people (including
Napoleon, Nelson and Washington), a carpet with the signs of the zodiac in
two different systems and described in three languages, and a carpet with a
beautifully rendered English fox-hunting scene (even to the highlights on the
horses' flanks). The paisley pattern is typical Iranian, though there is
dispute about what it symbolises (theories ranging from a foetus to a
Zoroastrian flame).
<p>
Back to the guesthouse for a short rest, then on to the next part of the
packed schedule: the concert. There was a delay in starting; the Director was
stuck in a traffic jam and we had to wait for him. They group (two tars, two
bass tars, two kamanches, nay, santur, percussion and singer) played a
non-stop selection in two "systems", the first mahur dastgah (major) and the
second nava dastgah (roughly dorian, but with the sixth somewhere between the
flat and natural). The next to last piece was in 5 beats (2+3); I don't know
if this is traditional Iranian rhythm.
<p>
Rick played one piece after that; the Iranian musicians came out to listen
and applauded him when he finished. (This was the surprise we had been
promised.)
<p>
Then it was the dinner, and very fine the food was, with fresh fruit
(including figs and watermelons) to follow.
<p>
<b>13/8/2003</b>
<p>
Today, at fairly short notice, I was asked to chair the problem session,
which I was happy to do. A good number of people contributed problems. A
couple had misunderstood the instructions, and thought that I just wanted the
problem handed in. One problem about crossing number was solved during the
session. Afterwards, Carsten Thomassen, Manouchehr Zaker and I reduced
another problem (finding a colouring of a graph given an oracle for the
chromatic number of induced subgraphs) to the problem of finding a colouring
given the chromatic number, which we think is NP-hard (but will have to
check).
<p>
Lunch was outdoors, a pleasant change to the usual routine.
<p>
In the evening we were invited to Shahriar's in-laws' house for a party. The
lady of the house had put on a fantastic spread, almost all made by herself.
My impression of Iranian food, the one preconception of the country I had
before coming (as a result of a not very good Iranian restaurant in Los
Angeles) has completely changed. It was a feast for the eye as well as the
palate.
<p>
Again a guitar was produced (a better one this time) and I was asked to play
(after the Wilsons had done a performance).
<p>
So once again it was nearly 1am when we got back to the guesthouse, Mandana
was on the edge; she had learned that she must accompany Dan Crnkovic to the
airport at 2am, and had said some intemperate words. I hope she hasn't
compromised her job; she is a jewel who will not easily be replaced. At least
it ended up that she didn't have to go. This was a glimpse of what might be
happening behind the scene to ensure that we are so well looked after. The
bus driver certainly has to keep very long hours; the man who among other
things produces a plate of melon for anyone who pauses near the kitchen for
more than a minute seems to be always on duty and always smiling and helpful.
<p>
<b>14/8/2003</b>
<p>
At 7:30 I managed to wake up and read through my slides for my last talk. I
found that the ones with the data on row parities and derangements in random
Latin squares of order ten were missing. Fortunately there are computers in
the guesthouse; I logged in to my computer and read the TeX file for the
slides, copied it out, and wrote out replacements by hand. Then, of course, I
had only a very short time to have a bite of breakfast before it was time to
go.
<p>
Mandana was back on duty with a smile on her face.
<p>
The morning session was long, and included a presentation by two
undergraduates on their work on a concept generalising chromatic index (it is
also required that, if two vertices are at distance k or less, the sets of
colours on edges at those vertices must be distinct. Not exactly my cup of
tea, but they gave remarkably good performances - for both it was their first
conference talk and their first talk in English, and yet everything was clear.
<p>
My talk went OK, and then Richard Brualdi (who had the grace to finish a few
minutes early) gave a very good thanks to the organisers and we were done. It
remained to have lunch, to say many good-byes and take many photographs, and
return to the guesthouse. We were all so tired that after the obligatory
melon we retired for a nap.
<p>
We assembled for tea at 6:30 and then at 7 it was back on the bus. In the
garden of the Shah's private palace at Niyavaran there is a little craft
fair. We walked around the stalls. Rick Wilson bought a ney (which he can't
play, and probably will never learn, since several other kinds including
shakuhachi are ahead of it in the queue, but as he said, he can hang it on
the wall). It had some very delicate pokerwork done by the stallholder,
though it was made by someone else. They had a beautiful tar with a flower
picture on the front, but one string was missing and the others put on wrong.
Mandana bought us all a drink of perfumed water, but many people didn't like
it.
<p>
Afterwards, we decided to walk home. We walked down the edge of the park, and
decided to do a circuit. At one point, we heard some music, and found a
concert about to start in a tent; I would happily have gone, but the others
wanted to get on. The park also had the music of running water and cicadas.
At the bottom of the hill, the fountains and coloured lights in the big pools
were on.
<p>
We phoned the guesthouse to order pizza. (Two types are available: minced
lamb or vegetable.) Then Willem undertook to guide us home. After getting
lost a couple of times down dark cul-de-sacs, it took longer than expected.
At a bakery in a small side street, one of the guards (who has been very
friendly) bought us a loaf of some kind of shortbread-like confection - I
felt happy walking past lovely old houses, eating the bread, and listening to
the stream which runs in a drain here carrying water and coolness from the
mountains.
<p>
Mandana told me that although public life is very restricted in Iran, private
life is completely free. I demurred, thinking of running, and she admitted
that not being able to use a bicycle does bother her. Women can drive but not
cycle: not very green!
<p>
The pizza arrived at the guesthouse at the same time as we did. We ate it,
then those who leave straight after the tour said goodbye to Mandana and we
went to bed.
<p>
<b>15/8/2003: Tour of Esfahan</b>
<p>
After a somewhat disturbed night (partly by Richard Brualdi teaching the
kitchen man to play solitaire on the computer outside my room), I woke on
the dot of 6:30, and managed to get ready in 20 minutes. Then I had time for
a leisurely breakfast before the coach at 7:30.
<p>
The journey to the airport was much less fraught than my journey the other
way on Saturday. We made a small detour to pick up Reza, and arrived there at
about 8:15. So there were fourteen of us: four organisers, six invited
speakers, Kathy, two guards, and the photographer.
<p>
On the way I saw two things new to me in Tehran: beggars, and men on bicycles.
<p>
No problems checking in: they did us in bulk and didn't even look at
identification. Some delay at the gate, though; apparently the seats on the
plane needed fixing!
<p>
I was over the wing and not by the window, so little to see except glimpses
coming in to Esfahan. But they gave me one of the few English-language papers
they had, so I read that. A mixture of kids' stuff ("What do you get if you
cross a rabbit with a termite? Bugs bunny!") and news about whom the foreign
minister had telephoned recently. Quite a lot had an anti-American slant: a
report that the Americans had used napalm in Iraq taken from the Independent.
Scary, too: an item about the Guardian Council explained how it had rejected
two bills passed by Parliament. These implemented two UN resolutions, one
forbidding discrimination against women (rejected because against Sharia law,
which I infer enjoins such discrimination) and one forbidding the use of
torture (rejected on the bizarre grounds that someone would have to pay to
implement it - so a country which can afford to build the third tallest tower
in the world cannot afford to implement a law forbidding torture). An article
listing Saddam's crimes, which seem to consist almost entirely of actions
against Shi'ites. Also an article about the group who gave the concert we
passed last night: a world music group mixing traditional Iranian instruments
with electric guitars.
<p>
Esfahan airport is in the middle of barren desert, but coming into town
things became steadily greener: trees, herds of goats, then fields of wheat,
and many flowers in the town. A minibus and guide met us at the airport. He
refers to us as "the fourteen innocents".
<p>
The first stop of the tour was at a mausoleum (to, I think, the brother of
the eighth Imam of Shi'a) opposite the Ali mosque, with a minaret 50 metres
tall built a thousand years ago. The mausoleum had fine marble floors,
carpets, and calligraphic tiles including 110 names of God. Some very fine
tiles outside as well. The huge pictures of ayatollahs outside such places 
disturb me in some way: I thought Islam forbade the making of idols (which
these clearly are!)
<p>
The next was a real surprise. The last thing I had expected was a cult of
muscle building and martial arts. In a "gymnasium" or "power house" we
watched a performance which (according to the guide) originated at the time
of the Mongol invasion, when the Iranians toughened themselves to resist  the
Mongols with these exercises, including jumping and fast spinning, juggling
heavy clubs (up to 30 kilograms each), and swinging vast metal bows over
their shoulders. The walls were covered with pictures of men with bulging
muscles (two of whom were in the audience, though now much older). The master
of ceremonies had a huge drum and a microphone.
<p>
But it wasn't just physical. Among the audience were several poets who took
turns to perform (and apparently at one point argued in verse, though it
passed over my head). The whole performance was very ritualised. Someone
about to perform would beg others to go first, and they would all refuse
(especially if he was old and revered). At various points, health was wished
to various people (including our group). It turns out that our guide is
involved in this: he took a turn at one of the exercises with clubs, and
greeted many of the performers.
<p>
Remarkably, given the many male buttocks under tight fabric, ladies were not
forbidden, although none of the local ladies come.
<p>
The whole thing went on for an hour and a half; I was getting a bit numb on
the hard seat. Then we went for lunch in the Shahrzad restaurant, the best in
central Esfahan.
<p>
From an unprepossessing exterior, we ascended the stairs to a large and
impressive room full of people. The windows were coloured glass, there were
mirrors on the walls and ceiling, and there was a small glassed-in area with
many green plants. We were provided with a plate of bread and a plate with
half an onion and some mint leaves. First we had barley soup, then a
selection of four dishes: chicken in a delicious sauce, rice cake with
saffron, yoghurt and chicken, minced lamb kabab, and lamb shank. Extremely
tasty. Mock beer or Fanta to drink. Tea, coffee or dessert to follow.
<p>
Then to the Hotel Kowsar (the name is one of the rivers of Paradise), for a
complicated check-in with a very long form to fill in, and a nap before the
next round of sightseeing (though I squandered the nap time on my notes, and
wished I'd squandered it on walking).
<p>
First stop after lunch was the Masjid Jameh, which the books translate as
"Friday mosque" but according to our guide means "congregational mosque". The
guide, Reza, revealed himsef as a poet and an engineer as well as an athlete.
On the way out he recited to us four lines of his 54-line poem about Esfahan,
and in the mosque he discussed the engineering principles that have enabled a
mud-brick structure to stand for so long. Some of it was a bit dodgy (e.g.
mud bricks are "a semiconductor", and right angles allow light but not heat,
but in the main he was sound. The huge area of mosaic was most impressive.
For all that, the place was utterly deserted.
<p>
Next we went to the "shaking minarets", a tomb in a structure with two
minarets built so that, when one is shaken, the other visibly moves as well.
This has been going on for 700 years. A strong man shakes the minaret every
hour. (We were told that until recently anyone could do the shaking.) It was
built to attract the gullible with an apparent miracle.
<p>
Next to an isolated red hill topped with the remains of a vast Zoroastrian
fire temple. Our guide had of course been involved in measuring it. The site
was spoilt by a reinforced concrete reservoir just below the temple. It is no
longer used but cannot be demolished for fear of damaging the temple -- but
at least they are considering other methods of demolition  (chemical or
laser).
<p>
But no time to climb the hill; we must be off to our next stop. Back into
town we took a narrow meandering road by the river. It seemed too narrow for
the bus, and indeed we were stopped by the police and fined. Thousands of
people were out picnicking by (or even in) the water. There were many
irrigated rice fields, and some vegetables (most of which I couldn't
recognise).
<p>
Our next stop was a working Zoroastrian fire temple. Because the priest
wasn't there, the guide took it on himself to explain to us the basic tenets
of Zoroastrianism. Founded by Zoroaster, who lived a hundred years before the
Buddha, the religion has simple and attractive beliefs. The slogan is "good
thoughts, good speech, good actions". They like light: they pray in the
direction of the sun during the day, and the fire by night. They respect
nature, which led them to air burials (which paradoxically have been banned
by the Environment Department). Later the two Rezas disagreed about how many
Zoroastrians there are in Iran: the guide said 40000 but our Reza claimed
120000.
<p>
Now it was time to eat, so we went to a fast food and tea house (which didn't
serve tea). Most of us were content with a salad, though some went back
several times.
<p>
We took our tea in the splendid Abbasi Hotel, converted from a caravanserai
some time ago. We sat in the courtyard, with soft lights, fountains, quince
and persimmon trees, and the floodlit dome of the Blue Mosque like an ornate
moon rising just beyond the trees and rooftops. Afterwards, we looked around
the public rooms and saw the ornate interior, far grander than any of the
Shah's palaces we saw in Tehran.
<p>
A visit to the Imam Square, second largest in the world (behind Tienanmen
Square and ahead of Red Square). We walked round the square with its two
mosques and royal palace. The popular sport seems to be riding motorbikes
with two or more people on board through the crowd at a faster than safe
speed. Mars was high in the sky, a waning moon chasing after it.
<p>
Next the bus was supposed to take us to the old Pol-e Jubi bridge with a
former aqueduct above. But there was a revolution led by Willem, and finally
five of us with one guard set out to walk. Apart from a couple of scary road
crossings, it was a very pleasant walk down tree-lined streets. The bridge was
a fine structure in good shape, and the view of lights reflected in the river
was really stunning. Across the bridge, it was just a short walk to the
hotel: there were traffic lights, but they made little difference to the flow
of traffic. And so to bed: more of this ordeal tomorrow.
<p>
<b>16/8/2003</b>
<p>
On a wall this morning, the same size and style as the idolatrous pictures of
ayatollahs and the anti-American slogans, was the Windows logo.
<p>
Further in general, Shahriar remarks that the people who suffer most from the
regime are small children. What is done in many homes is illegal, though
tolerated. (I opened the Koran at random this morning and found a verse
forbidding one to enter another's house without knocking at the door and
being given permission first.) So the children must learn not to talk outside
about what happens in the home, or indeed to lie about it.
<p>
We went first to the palace with forty pillars, the Chehel Sotun. Actually
there are twenty pillars; the number is made up with reflections in the vast
pool. The pillars were wooden, and have been attacked by insects; so they
have all been given steel cores.
<p>
Inside the palace we saw some extraordinary miniatures, including a picture
with people committing homosexual and lesbian acts, to say nothing of the
inevitable flasks of wine. Yet another thread to the contradictions of Iran.
Several pictures showed musicians, mostly playing the instruments we heard in
Tehran, but, curiously,  one playing pan pipes.  Queen Elizabeth slept in one
of the rooms, and wrote to her hosts of her feelings; we were not told what
she said.
<p>
A short walk through a garden with birds following the play of the sprinklers
brought us to the Imam Square.
<p>
First, the Blue Mosque, or Imam Mosque. How can I describe the effect of such
huge areas covered with finely-detailed tiles and mosaics? The highlight was
probably the echo under the dome, consisting of many closely-spaced but
entirely distinct echoes. Here the guide was not wholly convincing. He said
that the sound is amplified because waves from the point on the floor under
the dome are reflected horizontally on striking the dome, and then back to
their origin on second reflection. 	This is a plausible explanation of the
amplification (one could easily calculate the shape of a surface which would
do this) but not of the clarity. His explanation of the multiple echoes, that
different paths give different echoes, is clearly wrong.
<p>
There was a fine view of workmen repairing the dome from the ravages of time
and weather. Many other amazing prospects - a minaret framed by an arch, two
sides of the courtyard reflecting one another, the square through the gate
arch - presented themselves as we went round.
<p>
Next, the Ali Qapu Palace. More wooden beams reinforced with steel. Most of
the plasterwork quite badly deteriorated, but in the music room right at the
top the cut-out shapes of arches, wine-bottles, instruments and so on (cast
in gypsum plaster) were mostly intact. These were said to transform the sound
of a single musician into that of many and increase pleasure - not for me!
<p>
Then across the square from the palace to the Ladies' Mosque (Sheikh
Lotfollah Mosque), with the striking peacock ceiling. (The ceiling
decorations formed the tail, a pulley hanging from a nail accidentally became
the head and beak, and a reflection from a window over the entrance formed
the neck of the peacock. Very striking.
<p>
We were assailed by beggars while waiting for the bus. I simply said "no" to
them (I have no note smaller than 10000 rials), but Reza gave then a small
note and then told them to go away or he would call the police. It was, of
course, a woman with a baby, and also a young girl in tow.
<p>
Finally before lunch, we went to the decorated bridge, the Pol-e Khaju, and
were given an explanation about how it also functions as a dam, and the
arches are of different sizes to avoid having disturbances all of the same
frequency when water is flooding through. Huge numbers of people were resting
in the cool, well-ventilated shade.
<p>
Lunch was a traditional Esfahan dish (which even many of the Iranians hadn't
eaten before), served at a restaurant which does nothing else. It consists of
lamb, boiled, minced, and then grilled, served in a large thin folded bread,
with pickle or yoghurt, and mint leaves and onions. I thought it very tasty,
but some of the group were underwhelmed.
<p>
Instead of a nap, I wrote up my notes, and then walked up along the river to
the 32-arch Si-o-Se Pol bridge and back on the other side. Many young men
practiced the first few phrases of English conversation on me:
<blockquote>
	"Hello!"<br>
	"How are you?"<br>
	"Fine, thank you. How are you?"
</blockquote>
There were boys playing in the water, and one small boy with a polythene bag
full of water containing small fish. Near the end of the walk, there were
people paddling swan boats.
<p>
I got back with ten minutes to spare before we were off for the last leg, to
the bazaar.
<p>
This was for me the most frustrating part of the trip. Shopping is not my
favourite activity, and left to myself I would have done a quick scan through
the bazaar and then homed in on something I might want. But no, that wasn't
allowed, we had to keep together, and having people watching me buy things is
very inhibiting! We were taken to a stall and shown printed tablecloths, then
to another stall with miniatures on camel bone, another with jewellery, etc.
Eventually I saw some bells and managed to buy one - expensive but with a
nice resonance, similar to the one that the drummer in the gymnasium had. It
will be good for chairing sessions at conferences!
<p>
I waited outside the bazaar, and a young man struck up a conversation. Soon
his friends joined us. They were students, mostly engineers. Our Reza
strolled over and joined in. After a while, one of the group said to me, "He
has a real sense of humour!"
<p>
Carsten and Charlie both managed to buy carpets; Rick and Kathy bought lots
of different things; and Willem, braver than I, spent the afternoon in his
own company.
<p>
Two small incidents. Someone asked whether the price quoted to foreigners was
higher than the "real" price, and was told, "This isn't Turkey!" Someone else
was thinking of buying a carpet in Aladdin's Cave but didn't have the money,
and was told that he could take the carpet and send a bank draft when he got
home.
<p>
After tea in a remarkable tea-shop (more like a junk shop), I got away and,
with Richard, went to buy some postcards from the shop near the palace. On
the way back, we were (separately)waylaid by two men wanting to practise their
English. Mine was a high school student whose uncle is a professor of
genetics.
<p>
Eventually it was time to go; guide Reza left us, stepping off the bus into
the busy traffic with nothing but a round of applause. We headed out through
the rush-hour traffic. (I have changed my mind about Esfahan traffic being
nothing to compare with Tehran; it is not as chaotic but grinds to a complete
halt more often.) Gradually the traffic thinned away, and in a lovely
twilight, the mountains stood clear and rugged from the flat plain, contoured
with shadow.
<p>
A bit of a wait at the airport, since we hadn't been delayed on the way. Time
for an ice-cream and a few pistachios, and to write the postcards. They are
only photos with printing on the back, very hard to write on with a fountain
pen. I hope the ink doesn't smudge too badly. There was only one stamp in the
whole airport, so I posted one to Hester, and will try to send the others
tomorrow sometime.
<p>
When we arrived at the airport the minibus wasn't there, but it turned up
shortly afterwards. On the way back, the bus was sideswiped by a car (no
damage done), and then we were held up because of a collision ahead.
<p>
Rick, Kathy, Richard and Charlie are all leaving tonight. I looked at Rick's
and Kathy's pictures of Esfahan, and went to bed quite late.
<p>
<b>17/8/2003</b>
<p>
Up just before 8. Today we are down to four. Carsten and Willem went into
town in an IPM car, Carsten to the carpet museum, and Willem to the National
Museum. Hadi and I walked in to the IPM, up a remarkable short cut involving
a lot of sharp turns and back streets (but remarkably few cars).
<p>
Reza is away today: his wife's mother died on Friday (I think) and he must go
to the funeral.
<p>
I finished typing up the problems, and then Hadi and I did some mathematics.
He told me about a construction of his using generalized balanced weighing
matrices, which produces a near-partition of the lines of PG(3,<i>q</i>) into
symplectic quadrangles, the intersection of any two being a fixed spread. I
proceeded to construct such an object, which is almost certainly the same as
his, from the Klein quadric. Several interesting questions arise: association
scheme properties; proving that the two are the same (which should help me to
understand the role of the group in a GBW); and looking at his extension to
higher dimensions, which only works in even characteristic and  where the
common part is bigger than a spread (but what is it?)
<p>
Carsten came back from the carpet museum just before lunch. So we switched to
talking about Willem's problem. Hadi ordered us lunch which was served in
Reza's office: it was excellent (chicken kabab, pickle, salad, rice, bread
and yoghurt). By the time we had finished lunch we were convinced that we had
a solution. The ad hoc argument seemed to work, but I checked it out with GAP
and got the same result.
<p>
Then the guys working on PSL(2,<i>q</i>) came and I had a session with them. We
finished working out orbit lengths for subgroups (except 
S<sub>4</sub> and A<sub>5</sub>, which I
left for them), and made a start on counting the subgroups and working out
the Moebius functions. We are now not too far from some kind of answer: not a
formula (that is too much to hope for) but at least a simple algorithm.
<p>
I rejoined the others and we got talking about whether we have settled the
problem about finding colourings. We are convinced that it is hard; we
tracked down a survey by Poljak in Discrete Mathematics 111 which might
contain the answer, but couldn't print it out; it seems that the IPM's
subscription doesn't cover that year. Further searches were frustrated by
computer problems.
<p>
By this time Willem was back. We showed him our solution and convinced him
that it worked. We decided to reward ourselves with ice cream. Offered the
choices Iranian or soft, large or small, we went for the first in each case -
and it was very filling!
<p>
When we got back, we wondered if our example for Willem's problem was really
the smallest. I was able to find one with just eight points, based on a kind
of swastika. By this stage we had run out of steam, so we walked home.
<p>
[Footnote: Later on, Donald Preece reduced the number of points to 7 by
identifying opposite pendant vertices.]
<p>
Willem had arranged to go to dinner with Mandana, and I decided to come too:
Hadi was visiting relatives and Carsten, who flies tomorrow early, wanted to
eat in. We took a taxi most of the way up the hill to a restaurant Mandana
knows. We sat in the garden; the temperature was perfect and lights hung from
the trees. The food was of the burger and pizza type, but nicely served with
salad and very tasty (even if they think that Greek salad has finely chopped
meat, no cheese, and lots of pink dressing). We had a pleasant talk about
language, literature, religion, and all those big things. Mandana has decided
to take the job at IPM. She gave me a learned English book on Persian
literature published in 1923. After a lovely time we walked together most of
the way home before taking our separate paths.
<p>
Farhad replied to my email; we meet at 5pm tomorrow to walk on the mountain.
<p>
<b>18/8/2003</b>
<p>
Mandana arrived at about 9:45 and set out with Willem and me for the bazaar.
This involved two taxis (don't ask me why - maybe they are territorial). Like
all shopping trips I didn't enjoy it much. Almost immediately we came to a
souvenir shop. Feeling under pressure I bought two woven mats and two lacquer
pencil cases. Then I was paralysed and couldn't buy anything else in the whole
bazaar. Not that there was much, except for some nice antique jewellery which
was probably far outside my range.
<p>
We had some curious drink - clear but full of tiny golden-brown bits swirling
around, and with an odd taste I can't describe.
<p>
Then we all decided enough was enough, and at that moment a shared taxi
pulled up. It took Mandana to near her house and Willem and I to the gates of
the IPM (though the driver was convinced we wanted the palace).
<p>
Reza was in - his meeting was postponed - so he, Hadi, Willem and I had a
nice talk until lunch. This was ordered in as yesterday, and was even more
excessive - pizza as well as chicken kabab. We talked and worked through the
afternoon until the gang came to see me and discuss the PSL(2,<i>q</i>) 
problem, with a couple more to be sociable. Then the others stayed on to talk
generally about mathematics, which I was happy to do.
<p>
Just before 5, I thought I would have a serious assault on Charlie's problem,
and managed to crack it. There is some subtlety in it! Then Farhad and two
friends showed up, and we set off in a car.
<p>
We started off at a little square tucked in between two cliffs. The road
followed the stream, and became a path with many steps. This part of the
stream valley was chock-a-block with restaurants. It seemed as if huge
numbers of people must come here sometimes.
<p>
Ascending further, we reached an old village, with an old mosque, a rooster
crowing, and a pair of mules bringing a load of empty bottles down. (We were
to see many of these, mainly mules but some donkeys, going up with full
bottles and down with empties.) At the top of the village, what had been a
stepped path turned into a steep trail over rock and gravel. The hills were
bare rock, but the stream valley was full of fine trees.
<p>
After a while, we reached the top of a ridge and saw a spectacular waterfall
ahead of us. Its name translates into something like "twin falls" and it must
be an amazing sight in the snowmelt. We continued up and overtook a big party
of schoolgirls (about 30 of them). Finally we reached a point not far from
the top of the falls, but to continue would have meant tackling fixed ropes.
Besides, we'd been walking for an hour and a half; I was quite tired (the
young guys outstripped me, though not by very much) and any longer would
have meant descending in darkness. So we turned back.
<p>
There was a glimpse of Tehran through the gorge (or rather, some buildings
dimly visible in the smog). At the bottom of the slope by the waterfall was a
pomegranate tree with some red fruit visible.
<p>
Of course, downhill was harder than uphill, with much greater possibility of
slipping. We came to a hut with running water, and splashed some on our hands
and faces. A man came out. He had drinks, so we took lemon beer. The others
also induced me to try a yoghurt drink which had to be shaken up. Sour, and
refreshing.
<p>
After a while, we caught up with four mules. Two crossed the bridge (the way
we'd come) and the other two descended to the stream on the same side. We
decided to follow them. The path was roughly level as the stream fell away,
and we were rewarded with a lovely view of the restaurants with their coloured
lights far below us.
<p>
Finally down a winding road brought us to just above where the car was parked.
<p>
I'd offered to invite the others for a meal, so we drove to a Macdonalds
clone in a lovely curving street lined with trees. I ordered a pizza and a
soft drink. The pizza was good, but the soft drink was much smaller than
Macdonalds size, and I was parched by the end of it. We went next door for
ice creams, which improved things very much. I had some purple berry,
chocolate, and Iranian ice cream (bright yellow with pistachios, like
yesterday). Then they drove me back to the guesthouse, where I drank lots of
water, emailed Charlie, said goodbye to Willem, and confirmed the arrangement
with Mandana.
<p>
<b>19/8/2003</b>
<p>
A leisurely breakfast, and I'd finished writing out the solution to Charlie's
problem before Mandana came.
<p>
We went back to the Sad-Abad palace complex. In one of the museums there is
an exhibition of miniatures by a 20th century artist whose name I didn't
record. Some lovely pictures in the classical style, some much more
challenging and disturbing, like his illustration of Omar Khayyam's ruba'i
where the dust is full of human faces and limbs.
<p>
Then we walked in the park discussing literature, ending up in a tea-house.
Mandana asked if she could translate my poems into Farsi, adding "There is no
copyright in Iran, of course!" She also said something which nobody ever said
to me before: "There is no `you' in your poems." She wrote out two of her
English poems for me, both very striking and effective.
I pointed out that although they both have "you" in them, they are both
first-person poems.
<p>
Then it was suddenly time to leave for IPM. We found a taxi quickly but the
traffic was bad. We went out to lunch to the place where the chicken kababs
came from, and had, guess what, chicken kababs... as usual, very tasty.
<p>
When I mentioned that I have six months' leave next year, Reza immediately
invited me to come to Tehran in April. Something to think about, but I told
him that Lyon have first claim.
<p>
In the afternoon I worked with the PSL(2,<i>q</i>) gang again. They had 
diligently found in the literature a general formula for <i>mu</i>(1,<i>G</i>) 
if <i>G</i> is soluble or if <i>G</i> is PSL(2,<i>q</i>). This is enough to 
count the regular orbits, but we need more detail (all values of 
<i>mu</i>(<i>H,G</i>)) to find all orbit lengths.
<p>
Home with Hadi at 6pm. Mandana came at 7 and we went to the Turkoman
restaurant in Jamshidieh park. Unusually we had to wait a long time for a
taxi; we'd just given up and started to walk when one came. It took us up to
the top of the road. We walked along to the next road leading up to the park.
There were many people waiting and no sign of a taxi, so we walked up the
hill to the park, and then up to the restaurant.
<p>
In the park, Mandana was greeted by a man who had been a servant at the
university where she was a student four years ago.
<p>
We sat at a table on a terrace at the restaurant with the lights of Tehran
coming on in the falling darkness. We had a plate of walnuts, cheese and
herbs, and some Turkoman dishes: beef and rice (a bit ordinary) and eggplant
and garlic (delicious). The herbs etc went very nicely in a folded piece of
bread; Mandana says this is a common Iranian breakfast.
<p>
Moths played around a nearby light, brilliant fluorescent white and appearing
as trails of shiny beads when they flew fast. Inevitably the flew into the
light and died.
<p>
After the meal we looked inside the restaurant, shaped and built like a
Turkoman house. An alcove covered in rich carpets, a central fireplace (this
would be nice in the winter), models of a man playing a tar and a woman
weaving.
<p>
Then we walked down through the park. There were taxis at the gate but we
decided to walk all the way, taking a bit over an hour altogether. Mandana
came to the guesthouse and took a taxi home from there.
<p>
<b>20/8/2003</b>
<p>
Breakfast with Hadi, who told me about his former classmate who, following
serious heart trouble, a stroke, and many operations, can no longer walk or
talk (but can say his prayers in Arabic), and wants only to see his daughters
married and settled - a difficult position for the daughters, I think,
especially one who is a mathematics professor at the university and doesn't
want to get married! Tomorrow morning there will be nobody here for breakfast.
<p>
After breakfast I found the references for the write-up of Charlie Johnson's
problem on MathSciNet, and finished that off, and also made some notes on
Hadi's construction (including workpoints for myself).
<p>
Mandana came, and I talked her into going to the Niyavaran park instead of
Sad-Abad (so we would not need a taxi). We were walking up the road when a
car came past; it was the lady from IPM with her mother and sister. They gave
us a lift to the park, and offered us peaches and sour cherries.
<p>
I suggested going to the art museum, but the ticket seller persuaded us that
the main palace was much more worth seeing, so we went there instead. Indeed,
it was interesting: both huge ornate public rooms with mirrored walls and
ceilings and lavish carpets and furniture, and the more intimate rooms such
as the bathroom with monogrammed bathrobes and towels, and the private
dentist's surgery. A remarkable collection of autographed photos of world
leaders: I recognised a few, including Eisenhower, Nixon, Queen Elizabeth.
<p>
Then we sat on a wall in a back garden near where the gardeners were watering
and had a talk, and later went down to the public park in search of tea
(which we found after some difficulty) and talked some more. Time passed, and
I was a bit late for the IPM, but when I arrived they had only just sent out
for the chicken kababs. Reza, Hadi and I had a very enjoyable lunch and talk
ranging over many things, mathematics, mathematicians, and far beyond.
<p>
Mandana showed up a bit before 6. She wanted to talk to Reza about the job
(which I think she is definitely going to take) but he had left early. So we
set off for the restaurant where we ate with Willem not so long ago, in
search of a cup of tea. After walking a fair distance up the hill, we decided
on ice cream instead.
<p>
Over coffee, Mandana translated one of her Farsi poems into English, I making
a few comments on idiom and synonyms along the way. She got to the last line,
"lightning strikes", and said that she didn't know what it meant. Suddenly it
all became clear to me. The poem is about play, and her form of play is
dancing. One day she will be dancing this poem, and lightning will strike,
and she will know what it is that she is looking for, she will realise that
the "I" and the "You" are one and the same. Moreover, she must know this at
some level, in order to write the poem.
<p>
After we had recovered from this shock, we walked back, and she left me at
the guesthouse.
<p>
<b>21/8/2003</b>
<p>
I set my alarm for 4:30. I slept very soundly until 2:45 and then dozed; I
dragged myself out of bed five minutes before the alarm went off.
<p>
While taking a shower I realised that, since all Mandana's poems are full of
play, she must have known that life is a game that we play as well as we can
- this was a casual remark I made to her which she took to heart, but my
remark must have been only a reminder.
<p>
I checked my email one last time before leaving. A puzzle: there is a message
from <tt>Administrator@maths.qmul.ac.uk</tt> saying that a virus has been 
found in an attachment I sent. Since it is a Microsoft virus, and since I 
haven't sent any attachments since I have been in Iran, I am at a loss to 
understand.
<p>
The driver arrived punctually, and at that time of day the journey to the
airport took only twenty minutes. The airport was ghastly. I had to stand in
the queue for three-quarters of an hour to get through the first security
gate. Then I queued for twenty minutes at the check-in desk, to be told that
my name wasn't on the list and the flight was full; I should come back at
eight o'clock. By 7:20 the queues had eased a bit, and so I went back. This
time several people seemed to be expecting me, and I was checked in double
quick. Upstairs through passport control, I came to the duty-free shop, and
made a final despairing attempt to buy something, getting a couple of mats
and a picture-book. The display screens were displaying last night's flights
and a Microsoft error message; I got to a lounge with two gates only, both of
them calling long overdue flights.
<p>
Compared to all this, our boarding was remarkably orderly, and we were away
only half an hour late, expecting to be early in London. After take-off the
women removed their scarves and we settled down for the tedious journey.
<p>
A six-hour flight, pretty much unrelieved tedium. It ended with our being
stacked for a quarter of an hour and then having to wait ten minutes while
they found us some buses. But the immigration queue was mercifully short.
