<h2 align="center">Durban to Cape Town, August 1968</h2>

<p>
In July and August 1968, I travelled from Australia to Britain on the
Shaw Savill Line ship <i>Southern Cross</i>, in order to study in Oxford.
I boarded the ship in Sydney; it called at Melbourne, Fremantle, Durban,
Cape Town, and Las Palmas before arriving in Southampton five weeks later.
The possibility of travelling overland between Durban and Cape Town was
provided; I took it, and here is the diary I kept at the time. I have
removed material not about the trip; it is otherwise unchanged, apart
from a postscript about things which I remember but didn't record. This was
the first country other than my native land that I had seen.
</p>

<p>
I took the photos with my Fujica SLR camera; I digitised the slides in 2009.
</p>

Today we started the Durban &#8211; Cape Town overland trip. Some of the
more vivid impressions follow.
</p>

<p>
Two Zulu guitarists sitting by the side of the road, waiting for the bus.
They both had very poor quality guitars, but their rattling added a beautiful
fuzz-like distortion. The rhythm player was laying down a beat which was
irresistible to a little boy, who couldn't keep his feet still. The
progressions were simple and repetitive, e.g. D, G, A, D or 12 bar blues.
The lead player was left-handed, and was playing simple but chordy 
improvising. His control was excellent and he moved all over the fretboard
without a glance at it. His style was different from anything I have heard
and his timing perfect.

<p>
A tree whose leaves were different in colour underneath and above, giving it
a totally different effect from different angles.
</p>

<p>
The quaint road signs: e.g. "Slow" followed a few hundred yards later by
"Slower"; "Detour ahead. Please be patient."
</p>

<p>
The excessively Old English hotel where we had lunch; the format of the menu
was very similar to menus on board ship, which leads me to suspect that it is
a typical English format.
</p>

<p>
Erosion in a gully, forming several "carved pillars" standing straight up
(about eight feet tall and eighteen inches wide, with a pinnacle roof on
top).
</p>

<p>
General comments: the enormous number of spacious luxurious houses on the
outskirts of Durban.
</p>

<p>
The native and Indian markets, particularly the food which seemed very
attractive to me (probably because of its strangeness).
</p>

<p>
The countryside, giving the appearance of a very severe drought, not like
Australian countryside where the vegetation adapts to the rainfall. Scattered
everywhere are the native huts, round and white with conical thatched roofs.
At night there are numerous fires to be observed, similar to stubble fires
but clearly not these (because of the striking absence of crops of any kind
and the poorness of those that exist). I noticed one small group of huts
silhouetted against the illuminated smoke of a ring of fire.
</p>

<p>
The isolated natives, on foot or bicycle, on country roads, whom the driver
made no effort to avoid.
</p>

<p>
The Holden with the Mercedes and Humbers outside the Hilton Hotel, and the
Arthur Upfield book in a shop at Kokstad.
</p>

<p>
Dancing with Mary at an Afrikaans dance with four bandsmen and eleven
spectators.
</p>

<h3>4th August 1968 (Sunday)</h3>

<p>
The tour took us through the Transkei (the self-governing Bantu territory)
and on to Grahamstown, the City of Saints, for the night.
</p>

<p>
Most of the Transkei was quite heavily populated and the round white huts
were scattered on the lower slopes of the barren mountains in their tens
of thousands. Closer to the Kei River (the Cape Province border) the country
became more rugged and huts fewer.

Impressions:
</p>

<p>
A FM transmitting mast on a bleak mountain overlooking thousands of huts.
The station was broadcasting in the Xhosa  tongue. The guide told us that 
many natives have transistor radios, and I thought of the invisible link 
between the mast and the huts.
</p>

<p>
The patterns of the sisal fences and contour banks on the opposing hillsides.
In spite of the contouring, there was considerable erosion, producing some
incredibly detailed erosion patterns in gullies &#8212; columns, pinnacles,
engravings, even caves.
</p>

<p>
The pink and mauve tones of some of the grasses and soils. In another part,
I noticed rocks and plants with a red tint set against the blue sky. The
contrast between white roads and black burnt grass; then the lack of contrast
of the acacias against the black background because of their dark green leaves
and deep yellow flowers. They form a more vivid contrast against the grass.
</p>

<p>
The running style of the native kids, which tends to be more economical and
graceful than one usually finds in white children of that size. As with the
whites, this grace is lost with age.

<p>
The geological structure &#8212; sedimentary (stratified) even at the tops
of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
An occasional hexagonal or octagonal native hut. (The enormous majority are
round &#8212; according to the guide, the thatching resists wind better &#8212;
with some square or rectangular, and a few more elaborate, based on a
rectangular style.)
</p>

<p>
The tender, delicate blues of the mountains in the dust haze, with surface
detail visible.
</p>

<p>
White dust raised by the wind, against which the huts were framed.
</p>

<p>
The trees seeming more beautiful because there are so few of them. The best
are eucalyptus.
</p>

<p>
A hillside looking like a tilted plain &#8212; even the huts were on an
angle.
</p>

<p>
In Butterworth, where we had lunch, every time one stepped into the street
one was approached by a couple of kids dressed in rags, begging with
sweet soft voices for four cents for bread.
</p>

<p>
The red-blanket people put on a show for us on the King Williams Town road.
The instrumental accompaniment was provided by a guitar and a 
didjeridoo-like instrument made from a gallon can and a length of pipe.
The guitar had only five strings, the tuning being in some cases one or two
semitones out. The chord progression was from a misshapen A7 to a misshapen
D7. The offbeat bass and the tuneless chant combined with this to produce
an eerie effect, punctuated with screams from cornets held by two other
natives at odd intervals. The others danced, fought with sticks, or walked
around begging for money or cigarettes.

<p>
The lack of brilliance in the sunset was surprising for the amount of dust
in the air. A pity considerning the impressiveness of huts silhouetted
against the sky.
</p>

<p>
I had my photo taken embracing a marble bust of Cecil Rhodes in the
Rhodes University foyer.

Today, the third day of the trip, we motored from Grahamstown through the
mountains to the coast, detoured inland to the Addo Elephant Park, had lunch
in Port Elizabeth, and followed the Garden Route to Oudtshoorn. 
Unfortunately we were well behind schedule and missed viewing the spectacular
mountains on this section. I found it not as rewarding as yesterday's
journey; some impressions:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">
<p>
This morrning we entered a new world; a green world of afforestation, scrub,
rich little farms and orchards.
</p>
<p>
The light green grass dotted with dark green trees and off-white anthills
and sheep. Two deer among the sheep.
</p>
<p>
Little local colour except for a native in a donkey-drawn cart.

<p>
The coastal strip, narrow and unproductive, growing only scrub &#8212;
typical coastal country. In one place, half a mile to our right the mountains
rose quite abruptly from the swampy plain; half a mile to our left were quite
high sandhills. Inland over the first hills was considerably richer, giving
way to the twisted and torn scrubby bushes of the Addo Elephant Park, where
we had incredible luck with nearly thirty elephants at a waterhole.
</p>

<p>
Lunch at the Elizabeth hotel, rather different from yesterday's roadside
cafe.
</p>

<p>
The rugged mountains, thickly green-carpeted, with a mighty high bridge over
a chasm under construction.

<h3>6th August (Tuesday)</h3>

<p>
This morning we visited the Cango Caves, set in grand mountains. Interesting
effects were created as shadow patterns on the limestone structures by
lighting (much of it coloured) in the larger caves near the entrance &#8212;
it is a sobering thought that these structures rested, not only unseen,
but unseeable, in total darkness for millions of years. I had the amazing
experience of crawling through narrow tunnels at the back of the cave, 3/4 
mile from the entrance and 600 ft.&nbsp; below the surface. Coming back, a
young American boy with me was suffering from panic &#8212; I 
underestimated the distance to go but my sense of direction worked well.

<p>
Coming over the Robertson Pass, on the left were red- and blue-purple
painted mountains with great detail delicately shaded in. On reaching the
top, we looked right and saw layer upon layer of mountains receding into the
distance, progressing from greens to blues and paling.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">
<p>
The coastal strip was much less impressive, being so like much Australian
country with which I am familiar.
</p>
<p>
At sunset we visited the Bontebok Park at Swellendam. We saw several varieties
of animal, including bontebok, glysbok(?), klipspringer, eland, and the
beautiful springbok. Two bontebok were silhouetted against a glorious
African sunset.

<h3>7th August 1968 (Wednesday)</h3>

<p>
An early start for the drive to Cape Town and a trip on the Table Mountain
cable car. Impressions:
</p>

<p>
The lights of a distant town trembling in the blue moonlight.
</p>

<p>
A beautiful dawn, with grape-coloured clouds against a bright orange, gold,
and pale blue sky.
</p>

<p>
Coming over Sir Lowry's pass, our first view of the fairest Cape of all, with
green fields, trees, little dams, roads, townships, the bay and beach, and
behind it all Table Mountain with its head in the clouds.
</p>

<p>
The delicate pink and gold western sky with grey-blue clouds just before
sunrise, contrasting with the earlier vigour of the east.
</p>

<p>
The rust colour of the first sunlight on the eastern mountains and clouds.
</p>

<p>
The cables of the Table Mountain cable car, disappearing up into the cloud.

<p>
So ended the trip; now a few general impressions of South Africa.
</p>

<p>
The geology &#8212; it seemed to be almost all sedimentary. The mountains
were unlike any I have seen.
</p>

<p>
The roads &#8212; first class, far better than the light traffic density
(except in the cities) would justify by Australian standards.
</p>

<p>
Generally &#8212; the country gives the impression of being old-fashioned,
roughly the way I picture Australia about twenty years ago. This shows up in
the new buildings architecture, the radio programmes, even the newspaper
advertisements. It also seems to be true of its ways of thought. It is
self-conscious about adverse world opinion almost to the point of paranoia.
The men we drank with at Oudtshoorn last night insisted that South Africa
was a good country and that we had misjudged it. Anyone who breathes the
word "equality" is branded a communist; even the Roman Catholic Church is
given this label for "teaching the natives that all men are equal when 
government policy says they're not". However there seems to be little ground
for any deep-seated fears they may have; the natives are too lethargic and
apathetic to turn the country into a bloodbath in the foreseeable future.
</p>

<h4>Postscript</h4>

<p>
Grahamstown was called "city of Saints" because of the large number of
churches, one of which is shown. The description of the Cape of Good Hope 
as "the fairest Cape of all" is due to Sir Francis Drake in 1580.
</p>

<p>
The animal shown in the Bontebok Park is a klipspringer; the "glysbok(?)"
mentioned should be "grysbok".
</p>

<p>
I am not at all sure why it fell to me to get the panicking boy out of the
Cango Caves &mdash; I had to cut short my own visit to do it.
</p>

<p>
The elephants in Addo Elephant Park are a different species from ordinary
African elephants, and are considerably smaller. We saw other animals that
I didn't record: lions in the Natal Lion Park (looking very motheaten),
and eland and rhinos in the Queen Elizabeth Park.

<p>
The point of the encounter with Cecil Rhodes in Grahamstown is that I
was a Rhodes scholar and would be supported in Oxford by the Trust he
set up.
</p>

<p>
We went to an ostrich farm, where we saw farmhands riding ostriches, and it
was demonstrated that an ostrich can swallow a Coke bottle (apparently it
would eventually be ground down by the stones in the ostrich's stomach), and
that ostrich eggs are strong enough that a man can stand on them.

<p>
It is hopefully clear from the account that the Black homeland in the
Transkei was considerably poorer country than the White regions on either
side (especially Cape Province).
</p>

<p>
The Afrikaans road signs struck strangely on someone knowing no Dutch:
for example, "Hoofpad" for "Main road".
</p>

<p>
While we were on Table Mountain, we had an excellent view of the harbour,
with our ship (holding all our luggage and passports) tied up at the
wharf, ready to leave in the early afternoon. The wind was rising, and
someone said that the cable car would stop running if it got any stronger.
Fortunately, we got down before this happened!
