<H2>Potenza, 12 - 19 June 1999</H2>

<h3>London - Roma, Alitalia, 12 June, 12:15</h3>

Left home just before 9:00. Uneventful trip to Heathrow. 
Just one change from routine: I used Barons Court instead 
of Hammersmith to change from District to Piccadilly. 
This was because a man was importuning the passenger next 
to me to sign a petition against greyhound racing, and 
was then about to give him some anti-vivisection 
literature; I happen to think there are more serious 
problems than greyhound racing, so I skipped before 
he got to me.
<p>
At check-in, I found the flight 20 minutes delayed, and 
it ended up quite a bit more than that. While waiting, 
I managed to put my coat down and leave it behind. The 
service not so good: no explanation given for the delay; 
long wait for lunch, which was a lot of dry bread and 
no butter, and nothing to drink except a small plastic 
cup of water until afterwards.
<p>
Dina was at the airport. She had left her car at 
Tuscolana, which is both more accessible and cheaper 
than Termini. We drove out to her apartment, where I 
left my stuff and we drank some water (I was quite 
thirsty by then), and then went to the very good, 
though cheap and unassuming, fish restaurant near 
the university.  After a huge and excellent dinner 
(no choices, it just kept coming), we went for a walk 
around Roma by night, something that Dina doesn't get 
much chance to do now: Villa Borghesi, Piazza Spagna, 
Quirinale, Trevi, Navona, etc. Covered quite a lot of 
ground! And so home.
<p>
In the morning I ventured out and got croissants 
for breakfast from the bar across the road. After 
breakfast, we went to the station to buy tickets. 
Just as well I'd done it in advance; the queues were 
dire, and of course several people desperate to catch 
trains wanted to go in front. Then we soothed our 
nerves by walking on the Gianiculo. The wonderful 
view of Rome from the top was mostly blocked by trees, 
but Dina knew another place to see it, near the 
Spanish embassy. We puzzled over the meaningless 
inscription MDCCCVC on a statue. Then to the station 
to catch my train.

<h3>Train journey Roma - Potenza, Eurostar, 13 June, 15:45</h3>

A small amount of trouble finding the train. I was 
sure it was the right one: the only 15:45 departure 
from Termini, and a Eurostar, and going to Taranto, 
which even with my limited Italian geography I know 
is in the right direction. But there was no list of 
the intermediate stops, and somebody told me it was 
not the right train; so I had to go and find someone 
else to reassure me that it was.
<p>
We were out of the suburbs of Roma very quickly. After 
leaving behind the Frascati hills, we were accompanied 
by hills rising sheer from plain; behind them an 
occasional, hallucinatory glimpse of a much higher mountain.
<p>
Crops: grapes, olives, peaches, nuts, citrus, loquats, 
some vine I didn't recognise. The bean harvest is over. 
Also there were artichokes in full flower, maize, 
pumpkins(?); and rolled-up straw on harvested cornfields.
<p>
A small castle atop a rock pinnacle, seemingly without 
access. A new high concrete viaduct with the old road 
meandering below. Escher-like towns covering hills.
<p>
Vegetation: tall rushes, some multi-leaved tree I don't 
know (but very common), figs. As pines and cypresses 
were left behind, prickly pear appeared. Purple vetch, 
yellow ragwort coloured the earth.
<p>
First view of the sea, from far and high: very blue, 
sparkling, with small sails. Then the train drove 
straight at an abrupt mountain wall, and plunged into 
a long tunnel; suddenly there were no more mountains, 
and we were in a dead flat plain with slow rivers, 
and a yard full of Zebu-type cattle.
<p>
Napoli from the train: a dreary city somewhat redeemed 
by oleander, morning glory and bougainvillea, and the 
looming cone of Vesuvius in the haze. For much of it 
we were underground.
<p>
Second view of the sea: closeup, murky and industrial 
along the Bay of Naples.
<p>
Vegetation now included oak, eucalyptus, and lots of 
broom. We ran through wooded valleys with fast-flowing 
streams and chestnuts trees, under towering cliffs; 
then drier, broken hills. The highway was much more 
intrusive than the railway, running on long viaducts 
and shaving off whole hillsides.
<p>
Then the best bit of all. A long stretch through 
half-tunnel, half-gorge. Glimpses of the small river 
far below and the hills far above, then back into the 
dark, through a projecting cliff.
<p>
Out of the gorge into flatter, drier country with 
cereals growing, and a large eagle hovering at Bella-Muro.

<h3>Potenza, 13 - 19 June</h3>

<h4>13 June</h4>

Arrigo was waiting right where I stepped out of the 
train. He was picking up two more people as well, and 
drove us up the hill to the hotel. Dinner at 8:30, just 
time to put down my bags and wash my face.
<p>
Good cooking (pasta, delicious vegetables with pork, 
a fresh apricot), but rather slow service, and we were 
barely finished when the waiter turned us out. Most of 
the summer school had been at the sea and all looked 
like lobsters. Afterwards we indulged in the local 
social life and visited the ice cream shop in the lower town.
<p>
Potenza is the only town I know where there is a lift, 
six escalators and a flight of steps to take you between 
the two parts of the town. The hotel is near the top, 
just along the street from the Governor's residence. 
There are probably spectacular views, but I haven't 
found them yet.
<p>
I went back early to prepare my first lectures.

<h4>14 June</h4>

The air at night is cool but the town is noisy. I woke 
at 6am when something buzzed, and then went back to 
sleep until 7am. Showered, made some more notes, went 
down to breakfast. Nothing is laid but the waiter 
brings croissants and coffee from the bar. Then I 
went back, wrote more notes, and headed down to the 
University, down seemingly endless flights of steps.
<p>
Pleasant campus, pines and rosemary. Lots of students 
at the summer school. I started gently, covering less 
in my first two lectures than I had meant: classification 
of quadratic forms, and coding theory as far as the 
Hamming codes.  The students are working hard, solving 
or debugging my exercises. One of the nicest questions 
concerned the left and right radicals of a bilinear form. 
I'd given as an exercise to prove that if one is zero then 
so is the other if the space is finite dimensional, and 
had remarked that this is false in infinite-dimensional 
spaces. I was asked whether, nonetheless, it holds for 
continuous bilinear forms. I managed to come up with a 
lovely negative example.
<p>
Let <i>V</i> be the space of infinite sequences of real numbers 
which are constant from some point on (let the limit of 
sequence <i>v</i> be <i>s</i>(<i>v</i>)), and define 
<i>B</i>(<i>v,w</i>)=sum(<i>v<sub>i</sub></i>-<i>s</i>(<i>v</i>))<i>w<sub></sub></i>.
Obviously continuous, left radical consists of the 
constant sequences, right radical zero.
<p>
Then a lecture by Gabor Korchmaros about recovering 
classical unitals from large subgroups of their 
collineation groups. He asked me whether a list of 
maximal subgroups of PGU(3,<i>q</i>) exists (only PSU(3,<i>q</i>) 
is in the literature). Of course I could only answer: 
it is possible to work it out.
<p>
Gabor was lecturing because Tamas Sz&ouml;nyi (who was 
supposed to be in harness with me this week) was 
called back to Budapest because his mother is seriously 
ill. Then after the lecture fate struck again. Another 
of his Hungarian replacements, Gyorgy Kiss, got a phone 
call to say that his mother had died suddenly. He is 
very bravely going to give his two talks tomorrow, 
but then will go. He looked absolutely shattered at 
lunch today.
<p>
So another part of the replacement will be a problem 
session, and I am now going to assemble a few 
problems before going for a run. I read my email; 
nothing urgent, but a nice problem from Yair Caro: 
if the order of an abelian group is congruent to 
1 mod 6, can you partition the nonzero elements into 
triples with sum zero? Yes, if the group is elementary 
abelian: just take cosets of the group of cube roots 
of unity in the field.

<h4>15 June</h4>

More on Yair's problem. There is an easy direct product 
construction. More generally, if the group has a 
homomorphism whose image and kernel have the property, 
then the group has the property. Thus, any <i>p</i>-group 
works if <i>p</i> is congruent to 1 mod 6; and, if <i>p</i> is 
congruent to -1 mod 6, then any <i>p</i>-group having a 
chain of subgroups with elementary abelian factors 
of order <i>p</i><sup>2</sup> works. A nice combinatorial 
argument shows that these are just the p-groups 
where no cyclic factor is bigger than the product 
of all the others.
<p>
The hotel is called "Tourist Hotel". It has a large 
crucifix above the reception desk.
<p>
The dinner situation is that it takes three-quarters 
of an hour between our order being taken and the 
first food appearing, during which time there is 
nothing but water and wine; and then the sweet 
course (last night, profiteroles and small pastries) 
is put on the table before we have finished eating 
the main course. But the waiter took tonight's orders 
last night, so perhaps they are proposing a more 
efficient system.
<p>
My run was most unsatisfactory. I got caught up on 
busy roads with no footpath at all, and then going 
back up the hill, when there was a footpath it was 
intermittently used for parking, so I was forever 
dodging and weaving. Despite this, I felt very good 
after the run.
<p>
We went for ice creams again. I didn't do my 
Cinderella act, but walked up the stairs with the 
others. As we reached the top of the long 147-step 
flight, all the clocks in the upper town began 
chiming midnight.
<p>
Several people have mentioned to me that Potenza 
is in a seismically active area. I trust that the 
buildings are constructed to cope with this!
<p>
I have now five problems for the problem session, 
most of them triggered by things people have said 
in lectures or questions they have asked me.
<p>
My run did some damage to my right Achilles tendon 
- a recurring problem at the moment. So I am limping 
a bit, but I don't think it's serious.
<p>
Mid-afternoon, I set out to walk the path by the river 
that Arrigo told me about. First, it took me quite 
a while to find it. The only crossing of the railway 
line I could find was a high wide and busy road bridge 
with no footpaths. Then I doubled back to the river, 
and saw the path below me fenced off with a high fence, 
and went some distance along the road before deciding 
there was no way in. Finally, I went the other way, 
and almost at once found the entrance. The path itself 
was separated from the river by a fairly high bank, 
and there was a smell of sewage, but at least the 
path ran without interruption.
<p>
It ran through an area of wildflowers, mostly yellow 
and pink-purple, including mallow and sweet pea, 
and also lots of fennel.
<p>
But not very far. It came to an old stone bridge 
which had been rebuilt and then superseded by a 
road bridge, and ended there. I walked over the 
bridge, and set off for home another way. At a 
level crossing on an abandoned-seeming railway 
line, along came a train pulling a German freight 
wagon. It was a three-man operation: one to drive, 
and two to stop the traffic on the roads they 
crossed. I walked on, and encountered them again 
at another crossing (the train was going quite a 
bit slower than I was). Finally I crossed the 
line and headed uphill, eventually finding the 
hotel after some messing about on top of the hill.

<h4>16 June</h4>

Before dinner, I had quite a long session with 
Serena Moscadelli, going through progress on 
her problem. She is trying to prove that if a 
group is a product of an abelian and a cyclic 
factor, then the rank of any chief factor is 
bounded by the rank of the abelian part. Surely 
true! She has proved it under a number of different 
assumptions, most notably that the intersection 
of the factors is non-trivial. I thought last 
night about how to finish, so far without success, 
though I have made a little progress. I also 
skipped the ice-cream outing to finish preparing 
this morning's lectures.
<p>
Lectures went well. I decided on the fly to put 
in my "one-line proof" of the upper bound for 
the number of bilinear forms in a linear 
non-degenerate set, and it worked; the students 
liked it, but liked the treatment of extraspecial 
2-groups even better. I was quite surprised by how 
many people hadn't seen this before. The third 
lecture was given by Guglielmo Lunardon, who 
arrived this morning.
<p>
As we came out for lunch, there was a very slight 
rain falling, just enough to bring a coolness to 
the air. I had two cartons of water with my lunch, 
something I should have done before; I get thirsty 
in the afternoon, especially if I run! Then after 
lunch I went back to Yair's problem, and did the 
cyclic group of order 25 with bare hands. So it 
works for any abelian group with order an even 
power of 5. I am now convinced that his conjecture 
that it is always possible is true.
<p>
I tried to count the steps this morning, but took 
a wrong turning somewhere. This afternoon, I made 
it 389 steps.
<p>
Two generalisations about Italians which contain 
some truth: they walk slowly, and they eat quickly.
<p>
I ran down to the river and along the path. I tried 
the other direction: the concrete blocks stop but 
the (very overgrown) path continues. I got stung 
and scratched but managed to avoid putting my 
foot into a pothole. There was some real running 
in places, a change from recent form! The final 
complement: back at the hotel, Philippe and Alice 
asked me a question about my lecture on the way 
upstairs, clearly not considering me too out-of-it 
to answer.
<p>
Before dinner I had another talk with Serena; I told 
her what I'd done and, at her prompting, managed 
to settle the case where the cyclic factor has 
prime order. Then the long-awaited storm came. 
There was a lightning strike very close, a terrific 
crash, setting off various alarms and the phone in 
the hotel lobby and crashing their computer.

<h4>17 June</h4>

Seven down, two to go. I did better on quantum codes 
than at Brunel, mostly because I had twice as long 
and I had done all the background. Now I won't 
really have time to do <b>Z</b><sub>4</sub> codes properly, so I 
will have to end with some handwaving, I think. 
Of course quantum codes raised a lot of discussion! 
Then I presented five of the nine problems at the 
problem session.
<p>
Another refreshing shower at lunchtime. The lunches 
are really excellent for a student canteen: today, 
lasagne, and roast chicken pieces in rosemary with 
beans and green salad.
<p>
After lunch, we had a little working group: Gabor, 
Arrigo, Angelo, Domenico and I talked about the 
problem of 1-factorisations in which every 1-factor 
is an automorphism. Gabor had almost proved (and 
I finished off) that if <i>n</i> is congruent to 2 mod 4, 
then <i>n</i>=2. My conjecture is that one of the 
1-factors is central in the group they generate. 
This would allow the possibility of induction. If 
the induction works, at least it would show that 
<i>n</i> is a power of 2, and at best it could give a 
complete classification. Anyway, if the group is 
imprimitive, then any block of imprimitivity has 
an induced 1-factorisation with the same property, 
so as a first attempt we should consider primitive 
groups. Some serious difficulties remain!
<p>
Then Arrigo and I walked up the hill together: he 
had business in the upper town.
<p>
Before dinner I went for a little stroll around 
the old part of town. Some buildings in a sorry 
state - no doubt damaged by the earthquake and 
never repaired - but many nicely restored. I saw 
a church with a lovely old carved wooden door, 
with figures of monks, naked women, pipers and 
devils along with the geometric floral patterns. 
At another church, a priest was blessing passers-by. 
At one fountain a boy was drinking; at another, a 
boy was washing his hair. All, of course, ruined 
by cars, driven aggressively or parked obstructively 
in the narrowest of streets.
<p>
After dinner we went for gelati again. Just down 
the street there was a show: just a couple of 
karaoke artistes in spangles and a magician 
quartering a woman, low-grade stuff, but we 
jigged and congaed around and enjoyed ourselves 
until they shut down for the night. This time, 
as we reached the main square in the upper town, 
the clocks were chiming half past midnight. We 
were adopted by a dog, who saw us safely back 
to the hotel.

<h4>18 June</h4>

The corridor where the students sit to work has 
a big sign saying "Vietato fumare" on one side, 
and a row of ashtrays on the other. Which message 
do the students notice?
<p>
I got quite a round of applause at the end of the 
course. I do think I understand the stuff a bit 
better myself now! Several Italian students thanked 
me for my clear explanations, from which I deduce 
that Italian professors don't always bother with 
explanations (true in some cases!)
<p>
After lunch, and another inconclusive session on 
1-factors (in which at least we decided that, if 
Baer's theorem says what we think, and we have to 
reduce to the primitive case and hack through 
O'Nan--Scott, at least we don't have to worry 
about the affine case), Gabor took Angelo and 
me for a drive.
<p>
As we were leaving the University we saw Serena 
and offered her a lift. She wasn't going anywhere 
in particular, so she came too.
<p>
Impressions of the trip:
<ul><li>
Out of Potenza, patchwork of fields in many colours 
on the hillsides. Gabor pointed out a typical Italian 
sight: a man in a car stopped on the approach to a 
level crossing, smoking a cigarette and using a 
mobile phone.
<li>
Pignola: the old village on top of its inaccessible 
hill, the new village on the road by-passing it. 
A tiny football pitch being used and kids playing 
football in the street: not much level ground in 
the village.
<li>
Up into the mountains. First, open, dryish country 
with masses of broom in flower and the tunnels, 
bridges and embankments of a disused railway line. 
Then into thick forest, lots of oak and chestnut. 
We stopped at a ski-lift at 1400m (the height of 
Ben Nevis, but what a contrast in weather!).
<li>
Large flock of cows (some with calves) and horses 
(many with foals); the cowbells made continuous 
music. Grey ashy soil and flaking brown rock. 
Large thistles, and other spiky plants with 
pea-like pink flowers. Over the ridge, an oak 
forest supposed to be a good place for mushrooms 
in the autumn. Clouds swirling about the television 
masts on the summit (1800m).
<li>
The first spots of rain as we got back to the car 
turned into quite a storm as we drove down, and 
we had panoramic views of the lightning flashes. 
But it didn't last long before slackening to a 
shower. On the road near Pignola, two magpies 
were eating a dead snake.
<li>
We drove to a lake which is a WWF reserve. But we 
couldn't walk: first, because it is a conservation 
area protected by a fence all around, and second 
because it was still raining and threatening worse.
So back to Potenza past strangely-shaped hills, 
and up to the hotel.
</ul><p>
At dinner, there were just nine of us left: the 
four Belgians, four Italians, and me. With an 
indiscriminate mixture of French, Italian and 
English, we got on very well, and the two waiters 
joined in the fun. The meal finished with watermelon. 
<p>
After dinner we went for ice-creams. The same performers 
were on in the street, but the show was quite 
different this time. There were two live musicians, 
a keyboard player and an accordionist, and the lady 
in spangles was acting more like a dance caller, even 
going so far as to play mazurkas and quadrilles. The 
atmosphere was so informal that small children would 
climb on stage and ask her for her photo, and an old 
man went up and wandered aimlessly around the stage 
playing his mouth organ: nobody could hear him but 
nobody seemed to mind. We enjoyed ourselves greatly, 
joining in everything.
<p>
They stopped just after midnight, and we went back 
to catch a few hours' sleep. (The Italians and I 
are on the 07:48, the Belgians are taking a later 
train. There seems to be just one taxi, which will 
make two trips for the five of us.)

<h3>Return, 19 June</h3>

And departure. I set my alarm for 6:30 and, of course, 
woke at 5:30 from dreams in which I was very angry 
with various people (for good and not-so-good reasons), 
but slept again until 6:20, which was time to turn 
off the alarm and get up. Breakfast was available 
already, but by 7:10 there was no sign of the taxi, 
so an old guy from the hotel drove the first group 
to the station. The two girls paid him but wouldn't 
let me contribute.
<p>
It turns out that all of us (including another girl 
and a friend of one of the Potenza team) are in the 
same carriage. So, in a gentle, sleepy way, the party 
continues. It is a clear day except for haze on the 
hills, and the views are very fine.
<p>
A good sight of Picerno: a main ridge and two outlying 
hills, one hill crowned with a round tower and the 
other with an old village, new building spilling 
down the slope and along the ridge.
<p>
Luca Giuzzi told me that the first summer school he 
attended (as an undergraduate) was at Bella-Muro. 
Since the Eurostar stopped there, he had assumed 
it was a large metropolis, and he had been somewhat 
disconcerted to find nothing but the station and 
the conference centre in the middle of nowhere. He 
was reassured by the arrival of a car with 
Hungarian number plates.
<p>
Different impressions this way. The gorge, a 
mixture of intimate and panoramic glimpses 
between tunnels, the mountaintops covered with 
soft cloud; fields of grey-green olives on opposing 
hillsides; cliffs topped with red-roofed houses; 
a girl having a very loud conversation on a mobile 
phone and then (to everyone's relief) losing the 
signal in a tunnel; the Bay of Naples, and the 
muddy-brown colour explained (an optical illusion 
caused by the muddy-brown netting and railings 
between train and sea).
<p>
By a bit of seat-swapping, Serena came and talked 
to me about the possibility of doing a Ph.D. in 
London. I chatted with her and Luca the rest of 
the way to Roma (hence not so much observation).
<p>
We were about ten minutes late into Termini. I 
phoned Dina (under some difficulty: the phone was 
clapped out and her voice very faint, and the 
announcements of departing trains were almost 
non-stop). It turns out that she is having a new 
floor laid today because of the leaking pipes, 
and has to stay at home.
<p>
So, after buying my ticket from a machine (which 
asked me for too much information, in English), I 
went to the station restaurant for lunch. What a 
difference from Britain: from a very wide choice, 
I took penne with salmon, beef and olives with 
zucchini, a creme caramel, and a can of beer. 
Extremely tasty and filling, for about ten pounds. 
Then I went to find the train: a long walk to the 
end of the last of 22 platforms on the station, 
past building works. Only one train an hour! But 
at least it is non-stop - though that is because 
it hardly gets started, limping and crawling along 
and taking 40 minutes for the journey.
<p>
Two strange events at the airport. At check-in, 
the girl looked at my passport, typed "Sydney to 
London Gatwick" into the computer, got no response, 
and finally gave me back my passport. Then at the 
security check, the man in front of me was 
repeatedly setting off the metal detector. So I 
waited to put my bag on the belt until he was 
sorted out. The man behind me got very impatient 
and tried to push me through. The result: when the 
time came, I went straight through, he triggered 
the metal detector. Revenge was sweet.
<p>
I had looked at belts in London, hoping for a 
replacement for my disintegrating collection, and 
found that the cheapest to be had in the duty-free 
shops was 25 pounds. So I looked again in Roma, and 
found it was twice that. Roll on the end of duty-free: 
that is an utter rip-off. Eventually I found one for 
twelve quid and bought it. The cashier put it in a 
bag which he closed with tape saying "Do not open 
until after takeoff". Stupid - I slipped it out of 
the bag and put it on.
<p>
A long wait for boarding. I finished "Mariette in 
Ecstasy" and yesterday's Times crossword that 
someone had abandoned. The flight was delayed 
an hour and a quarter. The airline blamed traffic 
congestion, but the pilot told us that the crew 
had been delayed on an incoming flight and 
apologised on the airline's behalf.
<p>
Visibility was good when the clouds weren't 
covering. I saw clouds reflected in the sea, 
the Alps with almost no snow, farmland near 
Paris, and both shores of the Channel. The food, 
though, was lousy. Despite my passport having 
been inspected three times by Alitalia staff, 
I had to ask for a landing card.

<H2>Budapest, 3 - 10 July 1999</H2>

<H3>3 July</H3>

Woke at 6:10, quite tired after a heavy week. I was out of the front 
door by 6:35. Everything very quiet; little traffic, few people on 
the Tube. It all changed when I changed to the Piccadilly line, 
crammed with travellers and luggage. But still to the airport in 
good time, and nothing worse than a long queue at the security check.
<P>
Once we were on the plane, they announced a delay for air traffic 
control, but I had two crosswords to keep me occupied. The Guardian 
crossword's theme was "written by du Maurier, shot by Hitchcock", 
so we had "The Birds", "Jamaica Inn" and "Rebecca". But I do think 
it's a bit unfair to expect us to know where Rebecca came from! 
(Seems it was Manderley.) I didn't quite manage to finish it, and 
I dropped and lost the plastic bit of my pen, without which it is 
not much use.
<P>
Not bad lunch; better than Alitalia managed last month, with 
French Chardonnay. Clouds over England and France, but fine 
views once we reached Germany, mixed fields and woods with 
the occasional road or small town, mountains in the distant 
haze to the south, and flocks of small clouds safely grazing. 
We flew high (37000 feet) and fast (with a tailwind) trying 
to make up time. Further on, more clouds, fields and towns, 
less forests, and first sight of the Danube.
<P>
We landed and I got through the airport without any hassle. 
I like the way they have exchange, hotel reservations, and 
minibus ticket counter all in the baggage hall. The minibus 
takes you to any address in Budapest for the princely sum of 
1200 forints (slightly more than three pounds), or less if you 
buy a return. The down side is that you may have to wait for a  
minibus - about twenty minutes in my case. Then off along the 
airport road a mixture of old boneshaker, new superhighway, and 
detours for the bits in between. All of a sudden, the 49 tram to 
De&aacute;k t&eacute;r; the patterned tile roofs, characteristic bulging 
church spires, and narrow streets of downtown Pest. I was second 
last off: we crossed the Pet&oacute;fi bridge, turned down a couple 
of side streets, and there I was.
<P>
The Professor's Guest House occupies the top floor of a large 
student residence belonging to the Technical University. It's 
quite luxurious: my room is split level, with the bed on the 
gallery and everything else downstairs.
<P>
After checking in and changing, I went for a walk up the Danube 
and back. First I walked to the Academy of Sciences, partly to 
see if anyone was around, partly to see how long it takes (just 
over half an hour). Then I carried on up the Pest bank until my 
way was blocked by a tributary just above the &Aacute;rp&aacute;d bridge, 
came back and crossed the bridge, and passed many places I knew: 
the train to Szentendre, the Victoria Hotel, the trendy shops 
of Pest, the Mathematical Institute, the University. I checked 
the restaurant opposite the Institute, where Laci and I had 
invented the Pisa conference, but it was very crowded.
<P>
By then my tongue was hanging out. Just after the Institute 
I found a little shop and bought a litre of water, which I 
polished off in a little park opposite. Then food was the 
next problem. Just before Burger King became the last resort 
I found a little restaurant, completely empty. I had goulash 
soup, then chicken stuffed with cheese and apricots, with chips 
and a beer. Good but not perfect: the goulash was tasty but 
the meat wasn't hot through, and the chicken was a bit dry. 
Very cheap too: 1820 forints the lot.
<P>
When I came out, lovely soft twilight colours were covering 
the Buda hills. I walked back to the hotel, meeting Jarik 
in the corridor on the way back to my room.
<P>
Observations: I've not been here in summer before; a 
surprising number of people go naked. Also, when I first 
came, the third McDonald's had just opened; now there is 
everything from an Irish bistro to an Australian restaurant.

<H3>4 July</H3>

It was hot when I went to bed. Later a cooling breeze came, 
but stopped before dawn.
<P>
I woke early and couldn't sleep. So I got up and watched the 
sun rise huge and red over the rooftops. Then, of course, I 
fell asleep and had great trouble waking up for breakfast - 
I kept dreaming that I was getting up. But two cups of strong 
coffee at breakfast (when I finally got there) did the trick.
<P>
After breakfast, once I had gathered up the energy, I set off 
up the hill. I walked round the back of the citadel and joined 
my familiar route by the underpass. Then it was a steady climb, 
past the hairpin bend under the cliffs of Sas-Hegy with the 
little shop on the corner; past the tram circle at 
Farkasr&eacute;ti t&eacute;r, with its row of flower stalls; walking 
up the hill past the cemetery to the 53 bus terminus. (I 
remember this walk for the fact that I was here when the 
first hard snow came one night, driven on a biting wind. 
What a contrast today, the sun blazing and the berries 
ripening on the rowans.) The old bus shelter with its 
R.E.M. graffiti was gone, replaced by a new one in modern 
public transport style. But the hazy panorama of Budapest 
was not much changed.
<P>
I tried to find my way to 49 Kazmir utca, where I lived for 
three weeks in the garden room. The roads seemed to have 
altered, with all the new building going on. In particular, 
the steps seem to have fallen into disuse; presumably the 
nouveau riche don't walk to the bus stop! I did find it 
eventually.
<P>
Then up along the forest path beside the house, a long climb 
among the trees until it emerged into an alm rich with flowers 
and butterflies, familiar and strange. The most noteworthy 
wildflower had green pointed leaves, shading to a rich 
blue-purple approaching the growing points; but these were 
not the flowers, since yellow petals grew from the leaf-stem 
junctions further down.
<P>
Almost immediately I was among people again, and soon came 
to the restaurants and shops at the top of the cogwheel 
railway, where I had pork in paprika with noodles, 
sauerkraut, bread, and beer: very good!
<P>
After lunch I sat in the shade by the water fountain 
for a while, sweaty but relaxed. I thought about Serena's 
problem, and realised that my progress had been illusory: 
any subgroup containing one of the factors of G trivially 
is itself a product.
<P>
There was nowhere to buy tickets for the cogwheel railway 
at the top, so I walked down, following the line of the 
railway, along a street shaded by yellow-flowering acacia-like 
trees and white-flowering bean trees. Then through a park 
where, along with the boys playing football, there was a 
model being shot in a provocative pose pressed up against 
the netting, one of the acolytes holding a big drumhead-like 
reflector to illuminate her from below; and old men playing 
cards at a couple of tables.
<P>
To Moszkva t&eacute;r, with its banks of tram stops, and up to 
the castle hill. I remembered as I walked that I had made 
notes on this part of Budapest on my first visit, but they 
were in my bag which got stolen from my office, and I never 
tried to reproduce them. Anyway, this is a very picturesque 
area!
<P>
I walked past the Hilton Hotel engulfing the old priory, 
and past the Matthias church, to Fisherman's Bastion. But 
the steps down were closed, so I had to go on through the 
really touristy parts until I found another way down, which 
took me right to Clark &Aacute;d&aacute;m t&eacute;r at the end of the 
Chain Bridge.
<P>
I crossed over and found registration in full swing at the 
Academy, with various old friends including P cubed and 
Vera S&oacute;s. They were selling 7-day travel passes so I 
bought one, and tested it out by taking the tram back to 
Szabads&aacute;g bridge. In the hotel, I had a very welcome and 
refreshing cold shower and lots of water.
<P>
Back on the tram to the party: very hot and stuffy, very 
crowded, lots of people there I know. The food and drink 
didn't last long, but a rumour came round saying that on 
the next floor up, in the art gallery, it was cooler and 
there was more to drink. So I tucked in again. In total, 
not really enough for dinner, but enough that I didn't feel 
the need to sit down to a meal. So back to the hotel. The 
twilight was fading, but the lights on the Chain Bridge 
hadn't yet come on. In a street near the hotel, two bats 
who couldn't fly very well.
<P>
A custom I've seen twice in two days: wedding parties 
drive in convoy, sounding their horns.

<H3>5 July</H3>

The conference organisers have forfeited some of the goodwill 
by various shambles. The opening session started late; 
then coffee was re-scheduled twice, and when it came, 
the serving facilities were quite inadequate for the 
numbers of people; there were no signs for the lunch 
room, and I and others were directed all over the building 
before we found the right place; lunch itself was somewhat 
on the light side, and then they charged for coffee; and 
every lecture room has two different names in English, the 
one in the program bearing little relation to the one on 
the signs. (Algebra is in the "Round Hall" or "Lecture 
Room", for example.)
<P>
I learned almost nothing from the preliminary talks about 
Erd&ouml;s. Predictably, Bollob&aacute;s didn't like Hoffman's 
biography; he doesn't realise that it is no easier conveying 
the creation of mathematics to the general public than 
that of music or art. Dvoretzky gave a more balanced 
judgment: he said the title, "The Man who Loved Only 
Numbers", angered him until he realised that it was at 
odds with the content of the book.
<P>
Then Noga Alon gave a very clear talk on the probabilistic 
method. (I'd never seen the probabilistic proof that 
graphs with arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number 
exists, but Noga fitted it onto a single slide.)
<P>
After lunch I was on first. Not my best talk, since I had 
no real fireworks to show, but it went OK. The room had 
a skylight, and the sun played havoc with visibility of 
the OHP screen until we moved the furniture around. The 
walls were lined with nineteenth-century academicians 
(very off-putting). Then Peter Paul P&aacute;lfy, and Laci 
Pyber (who has tentatively agreed to come in with me on 
the paper).
<P>
A nice question, from a Hungarian whose name I didn't 
catch. Is every residually finite (countable) group 
embeddable in the group of permutations of the integers 
which move every element only a bounded distance? (Perhaps 
one has to allow the integer lattices of arbitrary dimension.)
<P>
I got through the entire afternoon without falling asleep 
(only just!) After the last talk I read my email (two of 
which I knew about already), then wandered into town.
<P>
At a corner I ran into Laci. We had an ice cream, and he 
told me about a world music festival in the open air 
tomorrow and Wednesday. Earlier in the day I had been 
to the record shop looking for something by Mak&aacute;m, 
without success - and here they were. I shall have to go. 
We tried to get a ticket but the agency had just shut. 
I will try again tomorrow. Laci seems to be getting cold 
feet about the survey, unfortunately.
<P>
I went to a posher-than-usual restaurant for dinner. The 
food was good: lamb and tarragon soup, and medallions of 
pork with ham and asparagus. But they disgraced themselves 
in a couple of ways: they forgot to bring my beer; and they 
overcharged me. I revenged myself by leaving a 1% tip. (Of 
course, the sums were so small that it was hardly worth 
worrying.) After dinner, the sun was sinking behind the 
hills and its rays were catching a knob of cloud high in 
the sky.

<H3>6 July</H3>

A mulberry tree near the hotel drops unripe white fruit 
on the street. Further along, on the riverbank, ash-like 
trees carry heavy clusters of red and yellow seeds.
<P>
Peter Borwein gave a lovely talk interspersed with cartoons. 
My favourite was the research institute with two signs: 
"Unanswered questions" and "Unquestioned answers". He asked, 
"If Erd&ouml;s had got the job at the IAS in Princeton, would 
he have touched our lives in the way he did?"
<P>
At lunch I went to the agency to buy a ticket for the World 
Music Festival. On asking for a ticket, I was a little 
disconcerted to get the reply "How much?"  I thought they 
would know that! Turned out he meant "How many?" It also 
turned out that the park is very near the hotel (in fact, 
I think it is where I used to change for the alternate 
route to work.) So I will spend Friday evening with Csaba, 
and, with the banquet on Thursday, that fills my social 
programme.
<P>
After lunch I read my email; there was one from Willem 
Haemers requesting an abstract for the Seidel meeting. 
Fortunately I had written one, and merely had to re-type 
it via telnet. Two curiosities about the computers: they 
are called "Coax" (is this how they have to be treated?), 
and the keyboards have sun and moon buttons (I suppose for 
using them by day or night).
<P>
From the afternoon's lectures I learned, in a lovely talk 
by James Taylor, that I should know more about 
Galton-Watson trees. (The trees I am interested in are 
almost never G-W trees, but the techniques might extend.) 
But he described things I had believed but sweated over 
as "trivial".
<P>
Hungarian drivers only stop at pedestrian crossings in two 
situations: in traffic jams, and when there are so many 
people on the crossing that to continue would cause carnage.
<P>
According to the daily bulletin, there is a session on 
combinatorial number theory tomorrow afternoon, the first 
talk being on sum-free sets. That simplifies things; instead 
of my having to decide between Szentendre and a run, the 
choice is now made.
<P>
After the last talk I sat peacefully in the square with the 
ice-cream stall, drenched in late-afternoon heat under 
listless plane trees. I sat on the steps of the fountain. 
A breeze sprang up and cooling spray drifted over me. 
I watched people go by: girls in platform shoes, youths 
in trainers, two men in identical dark trousers, white 
shirts and red ties eating ice cream, a girl reading 
"War and Peace" in Russian, a pigeon and a sparrow scrounging.
<P>
Then to P cubed for the party. And plans for tomorrow have 
changed again: I have agreed to spend the afternoon drinking 
beer with two group theory students, at Csaba's instigation. 
So what did I do but spend half the party preaching to them 
on the random graph, random sum-free sets, etc. Here is an 
interesting question: is there a transitive torsion-free 
permutation group in which every cycle of every element is 
finite?
<P>
The other change of plan is that I am invited to lunch with 
Csaba and Eva on Thursday. I finally got to meet Eva at the 
party; we'd both heard so much about the other, but despite 
that we got on like a house on fire.
<P>
And so home on the 49 tram from De&aacute;k t&eacute;r, no change needed.
<P>
The weather forecast for tomorrow is cooler, chance of rain.

<H3>7 July</H3>

Definitely cooler today. Rumours of a storm at 16:00 this 
afternoon; I took a coat! I walked over the Pet&oacute;fi bridge 
for a change, and all the flags were standing out straight.
<P>
The tram took me past Nehru Park, where a girl was lying on 
a bench with her leg in the air, and the old warehouses where 
there used to be a flourishing market (now completely defunct 
it seems). 
<P>
The view across the river was unusually fine: the Technical 
University (which I'd only seen locally before), Gell&eacute;rt 
hill, the Castle, the Matthias church, were shining in a 
splendid way. What a beautiful city!
<P>
A lovely lecture by Joel Spencer, ending with his personal 
tribute. The other two lectures were similarly excellent in 
different ways: Lubinsky exuding enthusiasm; Elliott, an 
extraordinary performance getting inside Erd&ouml;s' 
achievements in probabilistic number theory. So far, the 
plenary lectures have attained a very high standard.
<P>
After lunch I went to the combinatorial number theory session. 
Unfortunately they had reversed the order, so I had to wait 
to hear Yuri Bilu talk about counting things like sum-free 
sets. (He described the problem as the Cameron-Erd&ouml;s 
conjecture, but said it was due to me but Erd&ouml;s had got 
interested in it and talked about it.) Nothing new on the 
original problem, but he can solve one of the generalised 
versions.
<P>

This made me late meeting the group theory students, so we 
didn't set out until after 3:15. We went to a bar near the 
University where they only had Amstel on draft, but we ate 
there (they hadn't had lunch yet, and I had a plate of 
goulash and dumplings to keep them company). After that, 
we went looking for (and found) the Crazy Caf&eacute;, where 
there is a much wider choice of draft beer. We had a good 
time, and I suggested a couple of problems which they found 
interesting. I also explained the basic facts about the 
random graph, as well as the B-group problem.
<P>
Then it was time for the music festival. I arrived a few 
minutes late, Mak&aacute;m had just started playing. There were 
eleven people on stage, including the singer (somewhat in 
the Marta Sebestyen style) and a didjeridu player who was 
only on for the first number. The others were 
multi-instrumental, playing a range of things from violin 
and saxophone, through cembalon and twelve-string guitar, 
to all manner of strange percussion including a terra-cotta 
water jar and something that looked like a sink plunger. 
The first number was four square, but I needn't have worried; 
they hit their stride with a number which started in 5 and 
moved seamlessly into 13, and we also had 7, 9, various 
3 against 2 rhythms, and so on. Lovely stuff. There were two 
of their CDs on sale; completely unable to choose, 
I bought both.
<P>
Next was a Zimbabwean group, Stella Rambisai Chiweshe, three 
men in matching Hawaiian shirts and dark trousers and a 
woman in all-over shiny white. They played mbiras, a standing 
drum, and maraccas. Interestingly, the drummer improvised 
rhythms in much the way that a jazz musician improvises 
melody; the rock-solid foundation was provided by the maraccas.
<P>
Soon after they started, the sky began to darken. Then what 
had seemed to be camera flashes turned out to be lightning. 
The wind sprang up, and the backstage crew ran round furiously 
securing things (even climbing in the scaffolding). Then the 
rain began bucketing down. The musicians had played on bravely 
through most of this, but the downpour brought them to a halt.
<P>
I decided that there wasn't much prospect of the storm passing 
quickly; so a bit reluctantly I decided to miss the chance of 
hearing Mynta (Indian-Swedish group including Zakir Hussain's 
brother), and walked back to the hotel through the dramatic 
lightning and rain, miraculously managing to turn down the 
right street.

<H3>8 July</H3>

A sparrow, sitting on the bridge under the railings,
takes off and plummets down towards the water far below ...
<P>
I took the Pet&oacute;fi bridge route again, hoping that the 
storm might have freshened the city and made it even finer. 
But thin cloud veiled the sun and made everything look a 
bit dim.
<P>
Ron Graham's lecture was a first: it was the first time I 
had seen a good lecture given using a computer. Two things 
were specially nice. In the bulk of the lecture, he used 
the computer like an OHP, except that, instead of covering 
up parts of the slide, he could make them appear as required; 
each paragraph appeared in large type and then shrank into 
regular type when the next one came up. Also, he did 
geometric demonstrations very well, the picture growing 
with the argument.
<P>
Richard Guy's introduction was also excellent. As he 
described it, a bad joke, and two Erd&ouml;s stories, 
one trivial, the other not. But it was clearly a heartfelt 
tribute.
<P>
The other two talks were not so much to my taste, for 
different reasons. Miki Simonovits talked about extremal 
graph theory, not my favourite topic; and Andras Hajnal's 
talk was given by Peter Komj&aacute;th, and involved a lot of 
reading from Hajnal's article in the Graham-Nesetril volume, 
which I have read (even the story of Erd&ouml;s climbing 
the church tower in Szeged).
<P>
After the talks I went to Csaba and Eva's place, right on 
the edge of Budapest (in fact, Csaba said that the Budapest 
authorities denied its existence for some time). It is right 
next to a conservation area; there is a large road which 
goes nowhere, since the rich folk on the other side of the 
Danube have successfully resisted its incursion.
<P>
We had a most enjoyable afternoon (and evening) - delicious 
food and drink, good talk, a not totally successful attempt 
on my part to charm their 14-month-old daughter (I had better 
luck with the two boys, who played Three Little Pigs with me 
in the role of the big bad wolf), and even a little mathematics.
<P>
When I left at 23:00, I had almost missed the last bus. 
Fortunately not quite, and it turned out that, after going 
to the metro stop on its regular route, it turned into the 
night bus replacing the metro, and took me all the way to 
Kalvin t&eacute;r, (though very slowly), from which it was only 
twenty minutes walk home. I got back about 00:15. Sad to say, 
I had drunk so much that I didn't sleep very well.

<H3>9 July</H3>

Rain this morning at breakfast. It had stopped when I left 
the hotel, so I decided that I needed the exercise and 
walked to the Academy.
<P>
I noticed that the Chain Bridge is Lanczh¡d on the masonry 
supports, but Lanch¡d on modern maps. Maybe Hungarian 
spelling has changed.
<P>
Beautiful entertaining lecture by Carl Pomerance - the clearest 
exposition of Erd&ouml;s-Kac I have ever heard, and the famous 
Hank Aaron incident (which was his own introduction to Paul) 
illustrated with a photo of the honorary graduands on that 
occasion. Peter Komj&aacute;th then gave his own talk which was 
mainly a catalogue of theorems but included one stunner at 
the end. A result proved using CH is then applied, via a 
forcing result which puts any model into a CH model, to 
showing the existence of a finite K<SUB>4</SUB>-free graph such that any
2-colouring has a monochromatic triangle. He has no idea 
how large this finite graph is from his method. Surely a 
challenge here for proof theorists). Ron Graham mentioned 
in his lecture that the smallest such graph known has 
billions of vertices, but it is not implausible that one 
with a hundred vertices exists. 
<P>
After the talk, Yair Caro brought me up-to-date with what 
he has done on the abelian group partition problem, and 
Laci Pyber gave me his comments on my conference paper 
(and explained why, as things are in Hungary now, it is 
better for him to have four citations than one joint paper 
(citations are counted, but not in your own paper!)
<P>
Then I headed back to the hotel for a nap. On the way I 
stopped off to look at the market in its newly refurbished 
hall (the building with the green and yellow tiled roof by 
the Szabads&aacute;g bridge). Wonderful displays of dried 
peppers, garlic, and sausages, their parchment shades 
completed to the Hungarian colours by heaps of beautiful 
vegetables. I succumbed and bought some paprika and some 
goulash cream.
<P>
The hotel lift has parallel mirrors, so I always feel 
there are crowds of people in with me but keeping out 
of sight. (But when there is someone else too, his clones 
don't hide.)
<P>
Of course, I didn't sleep, so I started working through 
Laci's corrections, accepting most of them. Then it was 
almost time for Miki's party, so I showered and dressed, 
and decided to walk over Gell&eacute;rt hill.
<P>
I'm told that there is a field somewhere outside Budapest 
where the statues of the Communist era  have been put (lots 
of Lenins, etc.). No doubt it will become a big tourist 
attraction, if it isn't already. But they decided to leave 
the one on the top of the hill - it is certainly the most 
prominent Budapest landmark.
<P>
Down the other side takes longer than you think, since 
the paths wind so, and many were covered with washes of 
mud from the storm. So instead of continuing past the 
Castle, I walked over Elizabeth bridge to Astoria and 
took the Metro.
<P>
Arriving at Heroes Square a bit early, I sat in the park 
under a willow, seeing the waiters bustling among huge 
flowerpots serving people on the lamplit terrace opposite, 
and twilight playing among the labyrinthine clouds, and 
hearing the sound of the fountains and the peeping of a 
lone duck.
<P>
A super party. The food was delicious and in vast array. 
Among the guests was someone I met half a life ago, Ethel 
Rathbone, secretary and mother-figure to visitors at 
Ann Arbor when I was there in 1973, now running the Number 
Theory Foundation and travelling with John Selfridge.
<P>
I congratulated Ron on providing me with a first. Other 
people around joined in, and liked the pictures growing 
in stages, but Ron himself singled out the shrinking text.

<H3>10 July</H3>

Checked out after breakfast. There was some delay: I asked 
the guy in the office to book the minibus for me; the girl 
wanted to know what number in Roosevelt t&eacute;r was the 
Academy! He offered a time which would get me to the airport 
in time; I took off half an hour; and the minibus girl took 
off another fifteen minutes. So it should be fine.
<P>
I took the tram, left my bag in the cloakroom, and decided 
to be a set theorist until coffee break. Shelah gave the 
clearest talk I've heard from him, though not the clearest 
transparencies! Jech struck me by talking of something 
holding "in ZFC", rather than "in any model of ZFC" - 
specially striking because the property of the Boolean 
algebras he was describing was most easily defined in 
terms of the corresponding forcing extension. Then Jean 
Larson gave a very entertaining illustrated talk about 
Erd&ouml;s and ordinals.
<P>
I read my email - very slow today, and several people were 
having the computers freeze on them - then said final goodbyes 
and went outside to wait for the minibus.
<P>
A hot, humid day, with enough breeze to stir the flags. The 
Castle in full face behind the Chain Bridge, the lady with 
the wreath grey in the haze, the statues in the square green 
with verdegris. It turned out that Professor Kanamori was also 
catching the minibus, and had been told the same time; it came 
right on time, had only one more (nearby) pickup to make, and 
got to the airport in half an hour (and then my flight was 
announced fifteen minutes late), so there was no panic at all.
<P>
Kanamori asked me to give Wilfrid a gentle nudge about an 
article on the history of model theory. I think the best way 
may be to ask him for a copy.
<P>
At the airport, through customs and immigration, I settled 
in for the long haul with a large lunch. Not quite my most 
expensive meal on this trip, but massive amounts of food: 
tuna salad, huge pizza, watermelon, and a bottle of Leffe 
(why not float out of Csaba's hometown on Belgian beer?).
<P>
Off at last, a bit late (I'd almost finished the Telegraph 
crossword before takeoff), in a table-less seat by the 
emergency exit. It was pouring with rain as we left, and 
quite bumpy at first, until we came through the first cloud 
layer into a little slit illuminated from the west. Then up 
through the second, gentler, clouds and out into brilliant 
sun - the magic of flying, I never tire of it.
<P>
Visibility later was better: western Europe blue with little 
clouds floating; the Thames estuary razor-sharp, from the 
Goodwin Sands like some giant smear in the blue water, 
Canterbury where I will be tomorrow, Southend with its 
pier and two stations. We flew to the north of central 
London, but the major features were clear: the M25, the 
Thames Barrier, the Dome, Tower Bridge. And approaching 
Heathrow from the west, a splendid view of Windsor Castle.
<P>
I did my good deed for the day by helping Frank Harary get 
to Victoria: minding his luggage while he went to the gents', 
giving him the fare to avoid joining a horrendously long 
line. (Of the two machines which can take notes, one said 
"Exact fare only", the other "Closed". Back in London 
all right.)
