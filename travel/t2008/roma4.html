<h4>25 September</h4>

<p>
On waking, I thought about PSp(4,3) again. I realised that I could prove
exactly the reverse of what I wanted for this, and indeed for all classical
groups. What we require for non-spreading is a multiset <i>A</i> and a
set <i>B</i>, such that |<i>A</i>| divides <i>n</i> and <i>A<i> meets every
translate of <i>B</i> in a constant number of points. I can do this, but
with <i>A</i> a set and <i>B</i> a multiset. So I got up and wrote this down.
I cannot remember why Ben wanted it the way round he did, or indeed why
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> cannot both be allowed to be multisets.
</i>

<p>
Not terribly early to work, but nobody else there. I sent off the thing I
wrote to the synch list. There were responses from Bill and Alan to my draft
report on the Newton Institute programme; I revised it accordingly. Some of
what Alan mentioned I hdn't even known about; perhaps it happened when I was
in New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
Pablo arrived between 11 and 12, so I told him about the spreading business.
He has almost finished the computation showing that PSp(4,3) doesn't satisfy
the condition in the case where <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are both sets. I also
observed that if we allow <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> both to be multisets and
delete the condition that |<i>A</i>| divides <i>n</i>, the condition is
precisely equivalent to non-QI. So at least I understand that better!
</i>

<i>
Dan came a little after 1, so the four of us went to his favourite restaurant
on Via Tiburtina. He walked right past it at first and we had to backtrack.
I had penne arrabiata (good and spicy), and ssome delicious hake, with house
white wine, and coffee.
</i>

<i>
Back to the department, arriving ten minutes before I was due to talk. 
Francesca came and took us to the seminar room; by the time the boards
were cleaned and the data projector warmed up, it was time to begin. Dina
was going to be late, and had asked us to delay; but several people had to
go promptly at 4, so this was not possible. Actually Dina missed the 
chit-chat but got almost all of the serious stuff.
</p>

<p>
The talk went quite well. I apologised to the audience that I had too much
to say; I had to put the computer on a chair, and I couldn't read what was
on the screen; but I covered most of the important things I wanted to cover,
and I think I did the chit-chat quite well. Flavio D'Alessandro and
Arturo Carpi, who work on the &#268;ern&yacute; conjecture from another
point of view, were there, and talked to me afterwards, giving me a copy of
their paper. I also talked to Claudia Malvenuto, who with Benoit Larose
proved the same theorem that Ku and I proved; I told her about the work of
David Ellis.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, we went to the student bar and had a couple of beers. Then
Pablo, Francesca, Rosemary and I caught a bus down town. It took a long
and meandering route through the less attractive part of town, but finally
reached Piazza Barberini. We got off soon after, and walked around past the
parliament building (where they were changing the guard so we couldn't get
through), the Pantheon, and a small restaurant which
Francesca vaguely remembered and managed to navigate to without a mistake.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a long queue, mostly made up of American tourists; it seems
that this restaurant is in the guidebooks. They told us there was a 20 minute
wait; we were seated well before that but the order took a while to come.
But it was indeed good pizza, and we had an enjoyable mea.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, we walked further, down some very narrow streets and alleys,
through the area where the posh shops are, to the Spanish Steps. From the
top, we could see the dome of St Peter's, behind another dome in the 
foreground. The church of Trinita dei Monti was open, so we went in. Several
small figures in white, absolutely motionless, were kneeling in the front
of the church, I thought at first they were statutes, but I think they were
in fact real.
</p>

<p>
After that, we walked down the long straight road to Piazza Barberini, where
Pablo and Francesca could get the metro (he is staying with Francesca for
a couple of days) and Rosemary and I got the bus back. It was the 492, the
same bus we came on, but took a more direct route and was much less impeded
by traffic, so quite a quick journey.
</p>

<h4>26 September</h4>

<p>
We were too late last night to go to the shop, so I went first thing for
some breakfast. Bread was a problem; yesterday's bread had gone, except for
one sliced half-loaf, and today's hadn't arrived. (I discount plastic bread!)
But everything else was there.
</p>

<p>
Pablo arrived in the department fairly soon after I did: I had read my email
and got the Newton Institute report sent off (Dave had emailed to say it was
OK with him). There was also an email from Ben Steinberg, saying that his
definition of spreading is what is needed to prove the &#268;ern&yacute;
conjecture, but admitting that the subject has taken on a life of its own
and other definitions can also be contemplated.
</p>

<p>
So we sat down to look more seriously at PSp(4,3). The multiset <i>A</i>
we have is too big (cardinality 30), so we decided to look for a smaller one.
I explained my idea of looking for a short vector in the appropriate submodule,
and Pablo suggested using linear programming (with constraints to say that the
integer vector lies in the submodule (i.e. is orthogonal to all the sum-zero
vectors corresponding to lines) and has non-negative integer coefficients with
one coefficient at least 1.
</p>

<p>
MAGMA has a function to do this, and the documentation promises to find an
integer vector if one is asked for. To our surprise and initial disappointment,
we found that it produced a solution where the entries were decimals with
about 20 decimal places! But closer inspection showed that these were very
close to integers, and when we rounded them to the nearest integer we found
that we did indeed have a multiset of size 20 which satisfied the constraints.
So this group is indeed non-spreading!
</p>

<p>
At this point we stopped for lunch, and went back to the same place we've
eaten at earlier in the week. The special was spaghetti with funghi and 
seafood, which was excellent. We skipped dessert but had coffee there before
returning.
</p>

<p>
After lunch, Flavio D'Alessandro, one of the two guys here who work on the 
&#268;ern&yacute; conjecture came by and gave me a little tutorial on his 
paper (which I had speed-read after breakfast). I am sure there are some
very useful ideas there, so I asked his permission to send a digested
version to the synch list, and perhaps put him in contact with other 
people. His concept of an independent set in a transformation semigroup 
is in any case an exact generalisation of that of a sharply transitive 
set of permutations, snd probably interesting in its own right.
But his main theorem says that if a synchronizing automaton has such a set
then there is a &#268;ern&yacute;-type bound for the length of a reset word.
In the other direction, a synchronizing automaton necessarily has an
independent set.
</p>

<p>
After that I offered to give the next part of the tutorial. Amazingly we
managed to assemble Dina, Francesca, Daniele, Pablo, and (for at least part
of the time) Rosemary. So I explained my new view of spreading and QI, and
described what Pablo and I had discovered. Over lunch I had realised that
there is a nice geometric description of this 20-element multiset.
</p>

<p>
Then Dina read her email and found that, contrary to explicit instructions,
Rosemary's expenses have been sent to the campus branch of the bank rather
than to her British account. So she has to go there on Monday, and try to
negotiate something not involving carrying nearly two thousand euros round
Rome and London for a couple of days! Oh dear. Meanwhile I suggested an
outing to Lago Albano on Sunday, and looked up train times. If all goes
according to plan, we will go out on the 12:10 train from Termini and come
back on the 19:24. Pablo was beginning the computation for PSp(4,5), only
to find that the linear program wouldn't run because the computer kept
dividing by zero; we tried it theoretically but, modulo a few mistakes in
the calculations, the nice geonmetric consruction seems not to work for any
field order except 3. Strange! Also I had to prepare a reference letter for
Daniele in a sealed envelope; some panic while I tried to locate the file,
eventually finding it on the white toy (of course).
</p>

<p>
We went back to the student bar (just four of us now, Dina, Pablo, Rosemary and
me) and had a beer. I showed Dina the video of Logan and Lex, and gave her
and Pablo copies of the slides of my talk and the LaTeX file to generate
them. (Dina is going to learn <tt>beamer</tt>.)
Then we went our separate ways; Pablo to buy a cake for
Francesca, Dina back to the department, and we back to the flat, where I
wrote up an account of what Pablo and I had achieved.
</p>

<h4>27 September</h4>

<p>
It is said that John Lennon composed "I am the Walrus" while listening to a
two-tone British ambulance siren -- the first four bars of the vocal line are
alternating notes a semitone apart. Perhaps Paul McCartney was inspired to
the introduction to "Two of Us" by Italian ambulances, which have two notes
a major sixth apart. We hear a lot of them; the flat is quite near the 
Policlinico.
</p>

<p>
Some mornings I have found myself singing "Killing Floor", and old
anti-Vietnam War song by (I think) Blood, Sweat and Tears in the late sixties.
I didn't know wny until I realised that its instrumental break is similar to
the closing line of "Two of Us". Of course this also resembles the closing
of "Hello Goodbye", which for some reason never played in my mind. (Perhaps
it will now!)
</p>

<p>
It was colder last night. For the first time, I was unable to get warm under
a sheet. I may have to dig out a blanket tonight.
</p>

<p>
We had a leisurely breakfast and then set out to be tourists. We started off
towards Termini. While walking along beside the wall, we saw an extraordinary
sight: a suitcase was perched on a ledge among the vines, and two policemen
with a broom were attempting (successfully) to get it down. Who knows what
the story was?
</p>

<p>
We walked through the underpass beneath Termini, and zigzagged our way to
Santa Maria Maggiore, somehow missing the market which I remember being
round there somewhere. We went in. It is a very grand church with an
extraordinary ceiling and a colourful window in the west wall. 
The air was full of the light of camera flashes and the sound of cameras
being switched on, despite the fact that a service was in progress.
</p>

<p>
Out of the church, we went down the Via in Selci, past a house where I lived
for a month in the early 90s, climbed up the steps, and walked round to San 
Pietro in Vincoli, a much plainer church where Michaelangelo's statue of
Moses (with horns) is. We saw that and the chains in which St Peter was
supposedly held in prison. (I think the story is that the chains were
parted by an angel, who welded them back together afterwards). Along past
the engineering faculty of the university, and down past the Colosseum to 
the Forum.
</p>

<p>
We queued up, and were prepared to pay to go in, at the higher rate (since
we had no proof that we were from the EU), to be told that entry was free
today. We made the most of it, spending a long time, both up on the Palatine
hill, and in the Forum. A lot of it is closed off now; I can remember going
through the temple of the Vestal Virgins once before, but this was no longer
possible. Nonetheless, there were some astonishingly well-preserved carvings
and inscriptions to see, and the old Senate building was an extraordinary
space, converted back to something like its original state after having been
used as a church for some time. Being free, it was of course veery crowded,
with the noise of audioguides in the air. People walked around talking on
their phones and not looking at what they were walking past.
</p>

<p>
We went out up the stairs to the Capitoline, down the other side, and found
a small restaurant where we had spaghetti, beer, and coffee. The food was
fairly cheap but the beer was an astonishing price.
</p>

<p>
After lunch, we walked through the old Jewish ghetto, across the Tiber via
the island, through the back streets, and up the Janiculum. The day was
superbly clear, with some clouds building up, and we had stunning views over
the city of Rome, as well as the hundreds of statues of Garibaldi's patriots.
We got ice-creams (lemon and pistachio) and ate them looking at the view.
</p>

<p>
Then we came down past the lighthouse, the dead oak tree and amphitheatre,
the Bambino Gesu children's hospital, and down steps to the river. Crossing
over, we started heading for home. We could follow a more-or-less straight
course through the centre, just missing things we saw on Thursday night
(the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, and Piazza Barberini), but passing the Trevi
fountain (which was more crowded than I have ever seen it). Then up past
the Quatro Fontane to Repubblica and the Baths of Diocletian, where the
garden was open (and free). 
</p>

<p>
We went in and sat for a while. While we were there, a rather lynx-like cat
came sauntering pat, paying not the slightest attention to anyone.
Astonishingly, it was only the third cat we had seen all day. I remember Rome
from my first visit as a city alive with cats, as Budapest is with dogs. But
I suppose they have had a campaign to reduce their numbers.
</p>

<p>
And so home, without ever quite getting to Termini. Near the place where the
police had been retrieving a suitcase, a bag lady was sitting on the pavement
with her supper all laid out around her, calmly eating it.
</p>

<p>
We went to the shop on
the way home for bread, and got a bottle of beer and some tartufo to make 
supper a little bit special. Back home, we spent some time organising photos 
before getting on with supper. Some have worked, some not, of course! One
was added at the last minute as the sun went down in a blaze of colour.
</p>

<h4>28 September</h4>

<p>
We had arranged to catch the 12:10 with whoever turned up, and so had a
leisurely start to the day. Walking to the station, we found both the bag lady
and the police at the haunted spot, having a heated altercation. Perhaps it
was her suitcase and she was annoyed with the police for taking it, who knows?
</p>

<p>
We got our tickets and waited. Dina came along with a bit less than ten minutes
to go, and said that Francesca was too ill to come. Dina herself was a bit
nervous; though she has been to Lago Albano many times, she has never taken
the train. She could, though, tell us something that I may have known once
but had completely forgotten. We should not go to Albano, which is beyond the
lake and over a very high ridge. She advised getting out at Castel Gandolfo.
When we came to Marino, I recognised the place where I had got out in the past,
but we stuck to plan and alighted at Castel Gandolfo.
</p>

<p>
This is a tiny station beside a busy road up the hill from the lake. Everyone
who got off the train started up the hill, and, after asking advice from a
knowledgable-looking person, we followed. Soon there was a turnoff forbidden
to cars, with a steep road soon becoming stairs, that led us right to the top,
coming out by the domed church with splendid views of the lake. A party of
boys wearing red, white and green garlands and surrounded by adults were 
listening to an address.
</p>

<p>
There was a nice-looking restaurant near the top, but it was obviously laid
out for a fancy party, so we didn't even ask. We went up to the main square,
where the Swiss Guard were standing in the doorway to the Pope's place, and
a bride was being photographed by the fountain (fairly clearly it was this
wedding party who were booked in at the restaurant). We went along the main
street a little way, and finally found a nice-looking restaurant, where we ate.
</p>

<p>
It was all a little bit strange. We had pasta with porcini mushrooms, a local
speciality (very good), and then some beautiful grilled lamb with lemon slices
meant to be eaten with the fingers; we also ordered a litre of local white
wine which turned out to be rather dreadful, but at least not too strong
tasting, so didn't spoil the food. The waiter had got the waiters' trick of
avoiding catching our eye down to a fine art; when Dina finally got his
attention and asked for some parmesan to put on the pasta, he informed her
that one shouldn't put parmesan on porcini mushrooms, and went to retrieve
the restaurant's one contained of parmesan, which was at another table.
Not quick, and not cheap, but the food at least was excellent.
</p>

<p>
Dina asked several people (the waiter, and a couple of street traders outside)
how to get down to the lake. Nobody could tell her; clearly the locals don't
walk! We aimed to find the steps back to the station, but missed
them and ended up walking down the road (fortunately on a footpath). We
continued down, and eventually found a small road almost impassable to traffic,
which took us down to the road on the lake shore. we followed it to the point
where cars can go no further.
</p>

<p>
Here we encountered a slight problem. The gates were locked, though it was
easy to step over the crash barrier and back again on the other side, and
there was a big notice which according to Dina said that access was forbidden;
but there were clearly many people walking down the road, so we followed. Dina
rather nervous lest rocks from the cliffs should fall on our heads (an event
I considered extremely unlikely). But, leaving the worrying aside, it was a
really lovely walk, living up to my old memories (though not quite the route
I remember), and thoroughly enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The woods were full of pink cyclamen flowers, forming a dense carpet in
places. There were chestnut trees laden with fruit. At many points there
were nice views down to the lake surface, and from opposite Castel Gandolfo
there was a spectacular display of sunlight streaming from the clouds (but
not onto the Pope's place, which remained in shadow). We saw cormorants sitting
on buoys out on the lake, and seagulls landing on the lake.
</p>

<p>
Coming into the built-up area at the north end of the lake, a very light
sprinkle of rain began. We decided to stop for coffee in a lakeside 
restaurant. It was as well we didn't leave it till later, since the 
restaurants further along were vast, and could obviously handle tourists
on an industrial scale. Anyway, the rain stopped while we had our coffee,
and the rest of the walk was fine, though we could see that it had rained
harder on the west side.
</p>

<p>
We retraced our steps up the hill. At the station, we were in for a shock, 
when the timetable said that the 19:24 from Albano didn't stop on Sundays.
We figured out a clever plan. Our outward tickets were for Albano, so we
caught the train to the end of the line, and had half an hour in Albano
before catching the same train back to Termini. It was a good choice. Instead
of being faced with the decision whether to climb back up again in search of
a bar or sit in the cold for more than an hour, we got to see part of
Albano, with an absolutely spectacular sunset over the plain looking towards
the sea. We climed up a flight of stairs to a little pedestrian place with
a fountain in the middle featuring tortoises spitting water into a pool,
took a look at the dreadful snarl of traffic on the main road to Rome (making
Dina very glad she hadn't driven), and went back to the station for the train.
</p>

<p>
The train journey back was pleasant, though it stopped for a while just
outside Termini and was a few minutes late. We parted in the subway, and we
walked home for bread, cheese and ham.
</p>

<h4>29 September</h4>

<p>
I woke at the usual time, and decided to be productive, so I got up and
showered and then started on a new version of the definitive synchronization
document. I'd made a good start by breakfast time (and managed to push
further during the day).
</p>

<p>
Then in to work for the last day in the department.
</p>

<p>
We arrived about 10. Dina came and took Rosemary to the bank. More bad news:
they couldn't transfer the money because they needed an account to transfer it
<i>from</i>... So she came away with a lot of money, mostly in very high
denomination Euro notes. Ah well, we will no doubt spend it one day.
</p>

<p>
I sent to the synch list both an account of our battle with PSp(4,3) and a
summary of the paper by Flavio and Arturo. (Later Ben replied that the
contents of this paper are not original, a more general result being known.)
Francesca and Daniele came and we talked a bit more about the numeration
systems and the possibility that Lyndon words have something to do with
the problem. More experiments required! Daniele offered to drive us to the
airport; I said I would phone him when we knew whether we had been able to
check in on-line. Tullio arrived and we chatted for a while.
</p>

<p>
Finally Dina was free, so we picked up Francesca and six of us went to lunch.
Since we had all that money, I suggested that we should treat the others. I had
lasagne, but there were more interesting things on offer: Tullio had tripe,
while Dina had liver and onions. Then dessert and coffee, all for a very
reasonable sum.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, I tried to check in but the BA computers were down. However,
we did succeed later on, and even succeeded in getting adjacent seats despite
our bookings having been made at quite different times. All I had to do was
click on a little picture of me in one seat, turning it green, and then click
on the seat I wanted. I opted to get a pdf file of the boarding pass, which
came straight to the white toy; Rosemary was in the computer centre, so I
copied it to London, emailed it to her, she copied it to Rome and printed it
out. All hopefully in order, and we were able to tell Daniele that he needn't
get up so early in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Finally all was over. We swapped pictures, I wrote a report on my visit,
handed over the keys and the computer centre card, and we set off with 
Dina to pay the rent, Dina coming along to
act as interpreter with Sergio. He invented some figures for gas and 
electricity (or so it seemed to me), but after deducting the plumber's bill
it was still a very reasonable sum for such a convenient apartment. We handed
over the money, he wrote out a receipt on a scrap of paper torn from his
diary, and finally he produced a bottle of grappa and four glasses to
conclude the deal.
</p>

<p>
We said goodbye to Dina and went to the shop for some bread. It was a rather
long wait just to spend 83 cents, but eventually back to the apartment, to
put on a load of washimg, eat the bread with some of the remaining ham and
cheese, and clean the flat.
</p>
