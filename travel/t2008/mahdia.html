<h4>11 May 2008</h4>

<p>
I realised when I got up that I hadn't checked for closures on the
Underground. The chance of an unaffected journey at weekends is currently
quite low. So I left half an hour earlier than I had intended, and of course
had a very quick journey. The sun shone and the trees were covered in
blossom: hawthorn of various tints, horse chestnut, wisteria, and some
tree in west London with purple candles. The parks very green.
</p>
<p>
I also realised that I had left the USB stick containing my talk behind; but
a copy was on the white toy, so I bought a cheap 1 Gb stick at the airport
and copied the talk onto it. No delays checking in. The girl at the desk
thought at first that I was very early for the 4pm Tunis Air flight, and
she couldn't check me in; but the misunderstanding was soon corrected. She
also encouraged me to take two bags with me. I explained that I was checking
the second one because it contained toothpaste.
</p>
<p>
The flight left slightly late because of airport congestion. In a light haze
with some well-shaped cumulus tops, we crossed the patchwork fields of
England, the blue Channel, and the patchwork fields of France. Flowering rape
gave a conspicuous yellow among the brown and shades of green of the fields.
We landed in Paris after forty minutes; the crew had hardly finished serving 
the snack.
</p>
<p>
Charles de Gaulle was something of a nightmare. First, it was a major
excursion from terminal 2E to 2F, with a very clunky security check; 
I only arrived five minutes before the flight started
boarding. Then the most absurdly stupid thing happened. We went through the
gate, down the steps, and onto a bus. After some delay, the bus took us about
twenty metres to another gate, where we went up the stairs and through the
airbridge onto the plane. During this amazing shuffle, I met up with Peter
Erd&#337;s and Ivo Rosenberg, also en route to the conference; Peter had missed
his connection due to a mistake in the ticketing, and had had to wait four
hours in this dreadful airport. He was quite close to the edge.
</p>
<p>
At least, after that, we managed to leave on time. Over Paris, more hazy
patchwork fields, more and denser cloud tops. They put on a fine display:
sharp-edged tumbles, wispy streaks, light almost solid enough to touch,
pockets of darkness. Once, a hole in the clouds showed the green earth,
with a hilltop village and walled fields. But soon the clouds joined up
into a featureless white blanket.
</p>
<p>
A tasty lunch came round, Air France keeping some standards at least.
But things change: the mini-bottle of red wine informed me that it was
Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot, produced in France, but you had to turn the
bottle around to find that it was a Pays d'Oc. By the sort of freak echoes
that often occur in aeroplanes, I could hear one side of a conversation in
the row behind me loud and clear.
</p>
<p>
After lunch I worked on my Manchester talk, and then we were in the cloud
and descending to Tunis. After a while the sea came into view, then a long
rugged headland protecting a beach enclosing a large lagoon. Several further
lagoons followed, and we came down across one to land at the airport, with
views of a town of flat white buildings.
</p>
<p>
Then the fun started. I had learned from the Tunisian Embassy website that,
unlike almost everyone else, I needed a visa, which I could get on arrival.
So it turned out. They directed me to a little office away from the
immigration queue, where my passport was taken and I was directed to a
waiting room where a television was playing and a man (who seemed to have
been there for some time) was sitting. After a while they came back and said
I needed to pay ten dinars. Of course I didn't have this, having read that
Tunisian currency cannot be taken out of the country and can only be obtained
on arrival. So the official took me past the immigration queues, through
customs (where, however, I had to put my bag through the scanner), and through
the exit gate.
</p>
<p>
There were Ivo and Peter with Maurice Pouzet and several local people. They
greeted me warmly, but I tried to explain briefly what the situation was and
hurry on. However, one of the locals produced a ten-dinar note. So we went
back through a different door, past customs, past immigration, to the visa
desk where I handed over the ten-dinar note and got my passport with visa.
By this time the people on the immigration desk knew about me and waved me
through past the long queues. After a bit of a hunt, I found that my other bag
had been taken off the belt and left in a pile of luggage. Finally I could
go through customs and out the exit door and rejoin the other mathematicians.
</p>
<p>
They took those of us there for a coffee while waiting for two more delegates
on a different flight. Then we had another quite long wait for the minibus
(or maxi-taxi, perhaps), but finally just before 8pm we were off.
</p>
<p>
The first part of the journey was straightforward, along a four-lane toll
road with not too much traffic (the only big vehicles were trucks with loads
of hay). Out of the town, we came to some hills; the biggest one had lights
and masts on top, another had had its face quarried away. On the flat ground
at the base of the hills were orchards, vineyards, and what looked in the
fading light like fields of ripening wheat -- can this really be so, so early
in the year? the dryish grass at the roadside suggests that it is. As it
became darker, I could dimly see the hills drawing back, and lights of a
town which seemed to be on the sea in the distance.
</p>
<p>
We turned off the toll road, and had a long stretch on a steadily deteriorating
road through urban sprawl, with lots of speed bumps and roundabouts, and much
heavier traffic including stopping buses. At least Mahdia appeared on the
signs at this point! This went on for a long time until
we left the town and found ourselves on a narrow winding road through low
scrub. After a few kilometres of this, we turned left at a roundabout, and
a few more kilometres brought us to Mahdia. A fairly long slog through the
town, and we stopped at the vast imposing gates of the Nour Palace Hotel.
A flunkey opened the gates and we drove in and disembarked.
</p>
<p>
We had to fill in forms identical to the landing card except for one extra
question, room number, which of course I couldn't answer! I got my key and
headed for my room. Confusingly the numbers in the lift are displaced from
those used by the desk, so that room 4047 on the fourth floor is on the first
floor according to the lift.
</p>
<p>
I thought I was far too worked up to sleep, but I dropped off as soon as I
hit the pillow, and was only woken by somebody using the bathroom next morning.
(There is not much in the way of soundproofing.)
</p>

<h4>12 May 2008</h4>

<p>
The view from my window shows a derelict open area with a few palm trees,
bounded by a white fence on the far side. This is the Zone Touristique, and
no doubt the plan is that it will be covered in hotels before too long.
But maybe the world economy will crash first.
</p>
<p>
After bathing and dressing I felt better, and went to find breakfast. The
dining room is absolutely vast, and has many serving points with no clear
pattern. I took something which may have been a Tunisian breakfast, consisting
of some bland sausages with pickled marrow and aubergine, juice, coffee and
fruit.
</p>
<p>
A sparrow was trapped in the dining room, and its cries were echoing round
the room, which seems to have very bad acoustics.
</p>
<p>
I was disturbed to see a greengrocer's apostrophe in the conference acromnym
ROGIC'S (particularly inappropriate since CS stands for Computer Science).
</p>
<p>
After breakfast, there was no sign of registration, but I found Nejib Zaguia,
who got my pack and badge for me and showed me the conference room. The
conference pack is the nicest such I have ever seen, a briefcase made of
beautiful soft leather and woven raffia, varnished against the rain; and
the conference book is one of the thickest I have seen, running to nearly
six hundred pages. To my dismay, the
projector was at an angle to the screen, and the computer started up the
PDF file with some program which used different keystrokes and gave two
exposures (differently aligned) per page. The first problem was resolved
after the opening ceremony by moving the table; the second was caused by
Ghostview, and was cured by opening the file with Acrobat instead.
</p>
<p>
The opening ceremony had been scheduled to start at 8:30 and last for 90
minutes. To everyone's relief, it kicked off about 9:45 and was quite brief.
Then was my talk, introduced by Jarik Nesetril. I was a little distracted by
the fact that Maurice Pouzet was so obviously enjoying it, and perhaps went a
little bit faster than I should have done. My watchtrap broke halfway
through; I managed to deal with it, and some people didn't even notice,
but it meant I had to guess the finishing time (which I did within two
minutes). The talk elicited several good comments, including a pointer
from Stephan Thomass&eacute; to some similar work.
</p>
<p>
The session I went to after coffee was distinguished by a speaker using an
indelible pen on the whiteboard (why were indelible pens put out?), which
Maurice (as chair) tried unsuccessfully to fix in real time.
</p>
<p>
For lunch I had some (rather dry) tuna in Sfax style, with lots of nice
vegetables. It seems you only get water if you pay for it. No problem, there
is water outside the conference room.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, the lecture rooms were extremely stuffy and airless, and
the doors were kept closed because of the noise. Small wonder that I fell
asleep several times. After the tea break, which had become reduced to ten
minutes because previous talks had overrun so badly, I decided that I would
just have to skip a session, so stood in the air on the terrace (with drizzle
threatening) talking to Debbie and Fiona.
</p>
<p>
Laflamme, in his talk, mentioned a theorem of Imrich and others according to
which the random graph can be partitioned into two subsets such that the only
automorphism fixing the two subsets is the identity. Later Stephan
Thomass&eacute; told me that he could do it so that each subset induces a copy
of the random graph. This led me to wonder whether such partitions can be
in any sense generic.
</p>
<p>
After the talks, we were divided into two parties and taken on a tour of
Mahdia by "small train". I was on the first tour and sat next to Peter
Erd&#337;s.
He is possibly even more cynical than I, but I think we egged one another on
a bit. Certainly the picture we got of the town is a vast area being covered
with hotels, where the building standards seem extraordinarily lax, and
an old town where the many of the buildings are in quite poor shape. Lots of
people were selling things in the street but nobody was buying. The point,
Cap Afrique, surrounded by a huge cemetery, was the only place of interest.
At one point we passed what was said to be a giant swordfish, but I could
only see its tail; it might have been a mermaid in a veil, for all I could
tell. I will try to walk back there at some point; a train is not the best
way to see such things.
</p>
<p>
After the tour I had dinner with Jarik, who thinks that there is a proof that
my problems about hulls are NP-hard, based on an argument about uniquely
colourable graphs. Certainly, if a graph <i>G</i> is uniquely colourable but 
not complete multipartite, then <i>h</i>(<i>G</i>) takes the
larger of the two possible values. Jarik's argument seems to hinge on the fact
that the categorical product of a graph <i>G</i> with the complete graph of
size <i>k</i> is uniquely <i>k</i>-colourable if and only if <i>G</i> has
chromatic number bigger than <i>k</i> -- a fact which I can presumably prove
for myself.
</p>
<p>
After dinner I finished off my Manchester talk and wrote up this diary.
I went to finish the session with a game of patience. About halfway
through, the computer put up an alert box telling me that it was impossible
for me to win, and inviting me to try another game. Of course, I ignored it
and continued; needless to say, I did win. What's going on?
</p>

<h4>13 May 2008</h4>

<p>
They have candles by the bedside. Does this mean there are frequent power
cuts? And do they expect people to smoke, and have matches or lighters?
People smoke in the lounge, which already seems rather strange to me.
</p>
<p>
The sun was shining brightly, with only light cloud. At breakfast I discovered
that they have loquats, so I had a couple. Very nice!
</p>
<p>
In the second talk, the small screw fell out of my glasses. Fortunately it
wasn't lost, and I got it back in; Fiona (whose fingernails were longer than
mine) tightened it as best as possible. Everything is falling apart!
</p>
<p>
The talk I was in finished a little early so we were down to the coffee room
by 9:45. The person guarding the coffee insisted that it was not available
until 10 (even though the program showed 9:50). I knew what would happen, so
I walked outside; when I came back in, he had yielded to the irresistible
force and was allowing people to take their coffee.
</p>
<p>
After a quick lunch I seized my chance to see the town, and set out walking
down the beach (having put off a hotel flunkey who wanted to give me a
guided tour). The beach was lovely: many beautiful shells, a few jellyfish,
very pale sand and blue water, glorious sunshine. But far too many hotels,
with their thatched beach umbrellas taking up too much space. Finally I
reached the town. 
</p>
<p>
There wasn't time to go to the point, so I walked randomly
through the narrow streets. This was so much better than the train trip:
lovely carved doors, some of them open and showing lovely wall tiles inside;
a shaded square opposite the mosque, and another one with tables and chairs
(many occupied) a little further along. There were shops selling carpets,
fabric, the brown flower-like crystals, and many other things; but they all
seemed to be having a lunch break and almost nobody invited me to buy
anything.
</p>
<p>
On the way back, I decided to stick to the road, since I was short of time.
It may have been faster going than the beach, but I am sure it was further,
since the road wound so much. But I did pass the swordfish, and could verify
that it was indeed a swordfish. Two men were digging at its base, and gave me
a wave as I passed. 
</p>
<p>
In town the esplanade was lined with palm trees, and there were planes in the
squares and a few Norfolk pines; a very few flowers in beds round some of the
palms. On the way back, many more flowering shrubs: oleanders, hibiscus,
plumbago, bougainvillea. Lots of sparrows but no other birds.
</p>
<p>
I arrived back only a couple of minutes late for Peter
Erd&#337;s' talk.
</p>
<p>
After the coffee break, the session I was in found itself without a chair,
so I had to step in and do the business. This session included both Fiona 
and Debbie; Fiona did a good job, if a little breathless, while Debbie
could have been more commanding than she was. But at least she got a question
which she was able to deal with effectively.
</p>
<p>
For the conference dinner, we had been instructed to assemble by the pool
at five to seven. I (and several others) smelt a photograph, but we were
wrong. After a while, we heard the sound of music, and a group made up
mostly of drummers came striding along the path, including one man on the
oboe and one holding a bucket of hot coals. (The sky was threatening a storm,
but maybe it was so unseasonably cold that the musicians had to keep warming
their instruments over the fire. At least, I don't know if that was the reason,
but that is what happened.) After giving a performance at the poolside, they
strode on into the hotel, beckoning us to follow.
</p>
<p>
In the doors they went and up the stairs. Most of the other hotel guests
were entranced, but a few went by with their hands over their ears. (We
knew from some of the talks that the hotel is a noisy place where every
sound reverberates, so this concentrated drumming was quite ear-splitting.)
They stopped in an open area and gave us another performance. Astonishingly,
the man with the fire bucket spilt a few burning coals on the hotel floor;
unperturbed, he simply picked them up and put them back in the bucket. After
a while, we were waved to our seats for the banquet.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the soup and the lamb, every dish was a collection of small but
tasty items, so we got to sample a wide range of things. Before the main
course of lamb, the chef came in with great ceremony and cut off the top
of a terracotta pot with a lethal weapon. The dessert included a few dates,
the rest being extremely sweet pieces of pastry or sweetmeats. While
we ate, we were regaled by a completely different sort of music, a man with
a lute and a backing track playing cheesy old standards such as It's Now or
Never, My Way, Something Stupid, Hotel California.
</p>

<h4>14 May 2008</h4>

<p>
It is clear that, as the word "vain" means "empty" as well as "self-important",
the derived noun "vanity" should share both meanings. The hotel in New
Zealand had a "vanity kit", and I thought only of this meaning until I saw
the title of Schopenhauer's essay "On the vanity of existence". Similarly,
"apparent" means both "obvious" and "not real", but I only attributed the
second meaning to the adverb "apparently" until Jack van Lint used it in
a mathematical paper with the first meaning.
</p>
<p>
The day was even more lovely than yesterday. But we had talks from 8:30am
until 10pm with little in the way of breaks. We started with a nice talk by
Jarik, on the theoren that, given a finite set of finite structures, we can 
expand them with unary relations so that the structures forbidding these
form a Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; class; the reduct of its 
Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; limit is the universal
structure forbidding homomorphisms from the original class.
</p>
<p>
In the break, Honza Hubicka outlined to me his proposed new construction of
the countable generic poset. In some ways it was reminiscent of my work on
cubes with Sam Tarzi. I promised to send him the paper.
</p>
<p>
There was a talk on the orbit structure of an arbitrary group of
orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the real line. A nice theorem, but
it came at the end of a long sequence of fearsomely technical slides.
</p>
<p>
I had lunch with Gena and Robert and then sat in the sun. There were many loud
sparrows, but I saw other birds too: a pair of blackbirds (first in a palm
tree and then on the lawn) ad a swallow flying.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon saw a lovely talk on homomorphism-homogeneous digraphs by Dragan
Masulovic. People are beginning to take this stuff up! The most spectacular
observation is that the X-condition, which also arises in Debbie's work, is
the Riesz Interpolation Theorem in the case of differentiable functions
(with the pointwise order), which is thus a HH poset. He speculated that
homogeneity could replace some of the analytic arguments.
</p>
<p>
Anthony Bonato asked me a nice question. Start with either an edge or a nonedge.
At each time step, add one vertex joined to each pair of vertices in the
existing set. Are the resulting graphs isomorphic or not?
</p>
<p>
Then I was stuck in a lecture I didn't intend: I wanted to hear about
semifields and Hasse--Weil but the schedule had been changed and no
information provided. Also it is rumoured that there is a barbecue tonight:
Gena was assured so by the hotel desk but again there has been no information.
I am hoping there will be information about airport transport at some point.
</p>
<p>
When I escaped, I went to my room to shower. The toilet wasn't working, but
by jiggling it I managed to get it to go. I went downstairs to the poolside,
where people were slowly beginning to gather. It was a lovely evening, with
four birds of prey circling against a sunlit cloud in the deepening sky, and
the white buildings of the Mahdia medina on its point hovering over the sea.
</p>
<p>
Eventually we were invited to the tables. The barbecue was somewhat
slow-moving, and it was necessary to spend quite a bit of time queueing,
but between the queues we had a pleasant evening eating. (When I got to the
head of the queue, the sardines were not ready, so I made do with shrimps
and meat; pleasant, though the meat was very tough.) Inevitably we fell
further behind, so that the honorary talks by the two conference honorands
didn't start until 9:30, and we didn't finish until 11. Maurice Pouzet
gave a very characteristic talk full of ideas.
</p>
<p>
After the talks, receipts were finally available, and we were promised details
of transport in the morning. Maurice had two problems to pose to me: first,
whether a Steiner triple system in which all 2-point deleted structures are
isomorphic necessarily has a 2-set transitive group; and second, whether an
age with empty kernel and polynomial growth has a finitely generated algebra.
I was also asked a question about reconstruction of graphs which I couldn't
answer. By this time I really was quite tired, so I snuck off and went to bed.
</p>

<h4>15 May 2008</h4>

<p>
The person next door has an alarm which goes off repeatedly from 6am. From
this point I was unable to get much sleep, so eventually I got up and packed.
</p>
<p>
The day was hot and clear, but a bit hazy. No word about travel arrangements.
I went and had breakfast and then showed up for the talks. There were two
talks in parallel sessions, and then two plenaries, the second by Ivo
Rosenberg. Near the start  of the first plenary, Jarik came and sat behind me
and told me that he and I were to go in a taxi together which would leave in
half an hour, so that it would be necessary to miss Ivo's talk, and even the
last part of the talk we were in.
</p>
<p>
I snuck out at a convenient break, and waited in the lobby. Several people
came to say goodbye, or to ask me mathematical questions: I had to put off
the latter, since the taxi driver was already there, and we were only waiting
for Jarik. Finally we were off.
</p>
<p>
The same route as arrival, but quite a different impact during the day.
The first stretch had many olive groves bordered with prickly pear, then
we were in the urban stretch. Traffic was quite bad, and often we were
brought to a standstill. The towns were full of photographs of the President
of the Republic, big statues, new buildings going up, and so on. Occasionally
there were glimpses of the sea.
</p>
<p>
Finally we got onto the toll road, and the driver put his foot down. He
was driving at 180 whenever he could, talking almost non-stop on his mobile,
and gesticulating violently whenever someone else did something stupid
(which was by no means infrequent). At one point he asked us if we wanted
a drink, and pulled up at a service station and bought us coffee. Later, he
was pulled over by a police patrol for driving without a seatbelt. This
took several minutes, during which the two policemen were very good-humoured
and laughed aloud. When he got back in the car he shrugged and said it was
an act of God (I wouldn't have thought so).
</p>
<p>
The countryside was quite flat except for the hills near Tunis, with mostly
olive trees, but some figs and other fruit, vines, barley, etc., especially
further north. But there were stretches of completely unproductive flat
ground near the coastal lagoons. From the service station there was quite
a striking view over this flat ground to the coast lined with eucalyptus
trees, with two lines of light formed by the lagoon and the sea beyond.
At one place we crossed some water, and I saw a flock of birds that might
have been flamingoes (though they were not pink) or storks.
</p>
<p>
Finally we were at the airport. The driver didn't know where to go and had
to stop and ask a couple of times, though the signs were completely clear.
On the way he had been telling us that they only paid him five dinars for
the trip, and I was prepared for him to ask for a substantial sum; but he
didn't, and gracefully accepted a ten-dinar tip.
</p>
<p>
We went into the terminal, and Jarik checked in; my flight wasn't yet ready
for checkin, so we sat and talked for a while until it opened. On the way
through departure checks, I noticed that the people ahead of us had departure
cards; the queues were short, so we decided to brazen it out. Jarik went first
and got through, but I was sent back to fill in a card. Even then I got it
wrong: I put down my occupation as "mathematician", but the correct answer
was "professor", and the official crossed my answer out and changed it.
</p>
<p>
At the duty-free shop, Jarik bought some halva and pastries, and I was tempted
(against my inclinations) to do likewise.
We went to the gates, and sat in Jarik's gate lounge until the flight was
called. (Each gate lounge served two gates, and we were at adjacent gates,
but also adjacent gate lounges.) After that, I went to the next door lounge
and watched the swallows swooping outside the windows.
</p>
<p>
Our flight was twenty minutes late boarding. Getting on to the plane, I
took a copy of the Wall Street Journal, one of the few English-language
newspapers they had. I read about the earthquake in Sichuan (we were
completely isolated from news in the hotel) and was reminded of the
Falun Gong taxi driver's prediction in Auckland that China would have a
big earthquake at the time of the Olympic Games. (This one was 7.9 on the
Richter scale.) Now we will see how the rest of his prediction will go (that
the Communist Party will fall and the Olympic Games will be abandoned).
</p>
<p>
We took off on a warm hazy runway with the mountains faint in the distance,
and turned and flew over Tunis, with good views of the city, and the fields
and irrigation ditches flaring in the sun as we flew north-west to cross 
the coast near yet another lagoon. Soon after starting our crossing of the 
Mediterranean, the clouds started building up and there was nothing to see
for a while.
</p>
<p>
The clouds cleared over Sardinia, and I had a view of the rugged north-west
of the island silhouetted against the sun-reflecting sea. The sea itself
presented a remarkable spectacle. There were large areas of matt sheen,
reflecting the sun dully over a wide angle, interspersed with almost straight
rivers of sharply reflecting water, and criss-crossed with waves. I have no
idea what causes this. After a while the sheen decreased to odd patches,
showing up like sunspots against the dominant sharp reflection. We crossed
the French coast at an area of wetland, and then the clouds thickened again.
</p>
<p>
Further on, I saw another remarkable phenomenon: a very bright subsun was
reflected from the cloud layer. The straggly high clouds were silhouetted
against it like dirty cobwebs. This persisted for some time. Approaching
Paris, we flew over a flat plain of clouds with piled-up cumulus to the
side, but over Paris the clouds cleared to give a splendid view of the
city: Montmartre, Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the
Seine.
</p>
<p>
We landed at Paris on time, and I started out to follow the signs to
Terminal 2E. After a while, they took me down to the ground floor where
a navette was just about to leave, so I jumped on. The brochure says this is
air-side transport, but it isn't -- you still have to go through security to
get back to the gate. Fortunately I hadn't bought any liquids in the
duty-free in Tunis; they would certainly have confiscated it. They put me
through almost the maximum hassle: laptop out of bag, belt off, etc. Bloody
French!
</p>
<p>
There were nice views of clouds on the last leg, but they got a bit tedious
approaching London: we descended through one cloud layer only to find another.
But we landed on time, and getting through Terminal 2 was quick, since there
are not many non-EU passport holders on these flights. The trains came fairly
promptly, and I was home by just after 10pm.
