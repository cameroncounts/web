<h4> Diagonal groups (update) </h4>
<p>
Diagonal groups <i>D</i>(<i>G,m</i>) for <i>G</i> a finite simple group are
one of the classes arising in the O'Nan--Scott Theorem. However, they can be
defined for any group <i>G</i>, not necessarily finite or simple. With Rosemary
Bailey, Cheryl Praeger and Csaba Schneider, I have defined for each pair
<i>G,m</i> where <i>G</i> is a group and <i>m</i> a dimension greater than 1,
a geometric structure called a <em>diagonal semilattice</em> whose automorphism
group is the corresponding diagonal group. We also gave simple axioms for these
geometries. For <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, a structure satisfying the axioms is
precisely a Latin square, but for <i>m</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2 the group <i>G</i>
arises naturally from the combinatorial axioms.
</p>
<p>
These structures consist of <i>m</i>+1 partitions of a set, any <i>m</i> of
which are the least elements in a <em>Cartesian lattice</em>.  With Rosemary,
Cheryl, and Michael Kinyon, I have looked at larger sets of partitions
satisfying these conditions, and found connections with orthogonal arrays,
arcs in projective space, and MDS codes.

Finally, the paper with Sean Eberhard contains a mistake which we have been
unable to fix.
