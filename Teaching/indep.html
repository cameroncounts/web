Independent study module: Logic and Set Theory
</h2>
<p>
I will be supervising an independent study module in the first semester on
Logic and Set Theory.
</p>
<p>
The syllabus will consist of the first six chapters of my book <em>Sets, Logic
and Categories</em>, Springer, London, 1999, together with further material
as appropriate to individuals' interest.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested, please contact me as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Please note that I will not be around for the entire first semester; I have
planned visits to Germany in September and China in November. You would be
required to work without my immediate supervision for short periods.
