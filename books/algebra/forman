Dear Dr Cameron,

Having read a warm review in the most recent issue of Mathematical Gazette,
I hastened to buy your Introduction to Algebra. I have just worked my way
through chapters 1-3, and have also visited your website, where you invite
your readers to let you know of misprints. As you presumably know, the
website commentary on the exercises in chapters 1-3 does not always agree
with the book version of the same, and some misprints have crept in. Here
are details of a few misprints in the book.

Page 50, line -15. a(1-cd)=0.

Page 63, line 9. ab in X.

Page 79, line -13. The thetas should be on the right.

Page 83, lines 5-6. The phi and theta should be on the right.

Page 84, line 7. Delete 'for all g in G'.

I expect these tiny errors have already been uncovered, but I send them just
in case.

With best wishes,

Roderick Forman (Eton College Mathematics Department)
