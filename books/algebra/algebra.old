<H3>From the reviews:</H3>

By  Plamen Koshlukov in <I>Zentralblatt f&uuml;r Mathematik</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... a very good textbook in Algebra... The lecturers who are going to decide 
to use this book for their classes will make a good choice; they and their 
students will benefit a lot from this book.

<H3>A simple argument</H3>

Here is a much shorter proof that the commutativity of addition follows
from the other axioms in a ring with identity (Exercise 2.7).

<P> Expand (1+1)(<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>) in two different ways:
<UL>
<LI> (1+1)(<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>) = 1(<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>)+1(<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>) 
= <I>x</I>+<I>y</I>+<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>
<LI> (1+1)(<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>) = (1+1)<I>x</I>+(1+1)<I>y</I> 
= <I>x</I>+<I>x</I>+<I>y</I>+<I>y</I>
</UL>
Now cancellation gives <I>y</I>+<I>x</I> = <I>x</I>+<I>y</I>.

<H3>Solutions to exercises</H3>

Chapters 1-3. Others will be added.

<H3>A problem</H3>

Prove that there is no simple group of order 3<SUP>3</SUP>.7.13.409.

2. Can you explain what the following is about?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Curiously enough, the twelve-tone system has no zero in it. 
Given a series: 3, 5, 2, 7, 10, 8, 11, 9, 1, 6, 4, 12 and the 
plan of obtaining its inversion by numbers which when added 
to the corresponding ones of the original series will give 12, 
one obtains 9, 7, 10, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 11, 6, 8 and 12. For in 
this system 12 plus 12 equals 12. There is not enough of zero 
in it.

3. Hermann Weyl on Proposition 2.12(c), the statement that
(<I>ST</I>)<SUP>-1</SUP>=<I>T</I><SUP>-1</SUP><I>S</I><SUP>-1</SUP>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
With this rule, although perhaps not with its mathematical expression,
you are all familiar. When you dress, it is not immaterial in which
order you perform the operations; and when in dressing you start with
the shirt and end up with the coat, then in undressing you observe the
opposite order; first take off the coat and the shirt comes last.

The mailing list 
<A HREF=mailto:group-pub-forum@maths.bath.ac.uk>group-pub-forum</A> 
is for the discussion of any aspect of Group Theory. The reason for the name 
is that the spirit is supposed to be
that of a conversation in a pub at a Group Theory conference.

<P>

GAP and MAGMA are systems for computation with algebraic structures
including groups and rings.
