<h3>Recent results about the Shrikhande graph</h3>
<ol>
<li> The <em>design spectrum</em> of a simple graph <i>G</i> is the set of
positive integers <i>n</i> for which the edge set of the complete graph on
<i>n</i> vertices can be decomposed into copies of <i>G</i>. Tony Forbes and
Carrie Rutherford have shown that the design spectrum of the Shrikhande graph
consists of all integers congruent to 1 (mod&nbsp;96). </li>
<li> Alexander Ivanov has written an interesting account of the Shrikhande
graph inside the Higman&ndash;Sims (or Mesner) graph on 100 vertices. </li>
<li> Peter Cameron has shown that there is a <em>triality</em> associated with
the Shrikhande graph: take three pairwise dijoint copies of the graph, then it
is possible to put between any two the bipartite Dyck graph in such a way that
the resulting graph has automorphism group permuting the three copies as the
symmetric group, and inducing the full automorphism group of the Shrikhande
graph on each copy. </li>
