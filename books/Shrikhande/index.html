<h3>Recent results about the Shrikhande graph</h3>
<ol>
<li> Mikhail Klin reminded me that the Shrikhande graph makes an appearance
  in his paper "The strongly regular graph with parameters (100,22,0,6):
  Hidden history and beyond", in <em>Acta Universitatis Matthiae Belii</em>,
  series Mathematics Volume 25 (2017), 5&ndash;62, ISSN 1338-712X, ISBN
  978-80-557-1357-1, available <a href="https://actamath.savbb.sk/pdf/aumb2502.pdf">here</a>.
  This is a long tutorial paper on the graph of the title, commonly referred to as the
  Higman&ndash;Sims graph although it was first discovered by Dale Mesner,
  a student of R. C. Bose (and so mathematical brother to Shrikhande).
  (Mesner never examined the automorphism group of his graph; Higman and Sims
  were able to show that it contains as a subgroup of index 2 a then-new
  sporadic simple group which bears their names.) The Shrikhande graph is
  treated in detail in Example 4 in Section 2 of the paper; indeed, their
  construction of it, shown in Figure 4, is visibly the same as the construction
  using Seidel switching shown in Figure 10.1 on page 127 of the book. </li>
<li> The <em>design spectrum</em> of a simple graph <i>G</i> is the set of
positive integers <i>n</i> for which the edge set of the complete graph on
<i>n</i> vertices can be decomposed into copies of <i>G</i>. Tony Forbes and
Carrie Rutherford have shown that the design spectrum of the Shrikhande graph
consists of all integers congruent to 1 (mod&nbsp;96). This paper is on the
arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00859">2505.00859</a>. </li>
<li> Alexander Ivanov has written an interesting account of the Shrikhande
graph inside the Higman&ndash;Sims (or Mesner) graph on 100 vertices. </li>
<li> Peter Cameron has shown that there is a <em>triality</em> associated with
the Shrikhande graph: take three pairwise dijoint copies of the graph, then it
is possible to put between any two the bipartite Dyck graph in such a way that
the resulting graph has automorphism group permuting the three copies as the
symmetric group, and inducing the full automorphism group of the Shrikhande
graph on each copy. </li>
