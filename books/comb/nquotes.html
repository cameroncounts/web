It may not be a coincidence that the two systems in the universe
that most impress us with their open-ended complex design --
life and mind -- are based on discrete combinatorial systems.

Reasoning and logic are to each other as health is to medicine, or - 
better - as conduct is to morality. Reasoning refers to a gamut of 
natural thought processes in the everyday world. Logic is how we 
ought to think if objective truth is our goal - and the everyday 
world is very little concerned with objective truth. Logic is the 
science of the justification of conclusions we have reached by 
natural reasoning. My point here is that, for such natural 
reasoning to occur, consciousness is not necessary. The very 
reason we need logic at all is because most reasoning is not 
conscious at all.

At the end of the thirteenth century, Raymond Lully was prepared 
to solve all arcana by means of an apparatus of concentric, 
revolving disks of different sizes, divided into sectors with 
Latin words; John Stuart Mill, at the beginning of the nineteenth, 
feared that some day the number of musical combinations would be 
exhausted and there would be no place in the future for indefinite 
Webers and Mozarts; Kurd Lasswitz, at the end of the nineteenth, 
toyed with the staggering fantasy of a universal library which 
would register all he variations of the twenty-odd orthographical 
symbols, in other words, all that it is given to express in all 
languages. Lully's machine, Mill's fear and Lasswitz's chaotic 
library can be the subject of jokes, but they exaggerate a 
propensity which is common: making metaphysics and the arts 
into a kind of play with combinations.

A choice of axioms is not purely a subjective task. It is usually 
expected to achieve some definite aim -- some specific theorem or 
theorems are to be derivable from the axioms -- and to this extent 
the problem is exact and objective. But beyond this there are 
always other important desiderata of a less exact nature: the 
axioms should not be too numerous, their system is to be as simple 
and transparent as possible, and each axiom should have an 
immediate intuitive meaning by which its appropriateness can be 
judged directly.

Set theory has a dual role in mathematics. In pure mathematics, it is
the place where questions about infinity are studied. Although this is
a fascinating study of permanent interest, it does not account for the
importance of set theory in applied areas. There the importance stems
from the fact that set theory provides an incredibly versatile toolbox
for building mathematical models of various phenomena.

The Naturalist  theory of possibility now to be advanced will be

possibility to the idea of the combinations -- all the combinations

Mathematics . . . is concerned with a wider domain than that domain

The standard "foundation" for mathematics starts with sets and 
their elements. It is possible to start differently, by axiomatising 
not elements of sets but functions between sets. This can be done 
by using the language of categories and universal constructions.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>--oo--<P>

. . . in one sense a foundation is a security blanket: If you 
meticulously follow the rules laid down, no paradoxes or 
contradictions will arise. In reality there is now no guarantee 
of this sort of security . . .

<P ALIGN=CENTER>--oo--<P>

. . . the membership relation for sets can often be replaced by the
composition operation for functions. This leads to an alternative 
foundation for Mathematics upon categories -- specifically, on 
the category of all functions. Now much of Mathematics is dynamic, 
in that it deals with morphisms of an object into another object 
of the same kind. Such morphisms (like functions) form categories, 
and so the approach via categories fits well with the objective 
of organizing and understanding Mathematics. That, in truth, 
should be the goal of a proper philosophy of Mathematics.

. . . the word "theory" . . . was originally an Orphic word, which
Cornford interprets as "passionate sympathetic contemplation" . . . 
For Pythagoras, the "passionate sympathetic contemplation" was 
intellectual, and issued in mathematical knowledge . . . To those 
who have reluctantly learnt a little mathematics in school this 
may seem strange; but to those who have experienced the 
intoxicating delight of sudden understanding that mathematics 
gives, from time to time, to those who love it, the Pythagorean 
view will seem completely natural . . .

It seems to  us unwise to have insisted on teaching geometry 
to the younger Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, in order to make 
him a good king, but from Plato's point of view it was essential. 
He was sufficiently Pythagorean to think that without mathematics 
no true wisdom is possible.

. . . mathematical knowledge . . . is, in fact, merely verbal 
knowledge.  "3" means "2+1", and "4" means "3+1". Hence it 
follows (though the proof is long) that "4" means the same 
as "2+2". Thus mathematical knowledge ceases to be mysterious.

"One of the virtues of this simple but at the same time complex 
design", said Bembel Rudzak, "this design in which we see the

who look outward see the outward pre-eminent; those who look 
inward see the inward."

"There is transitive motion and there is intransitive motion: 
the motion of a galloping horse is transitive, it passes through 
our field of vision and continues on to where it is going; the 
motion in a tile pattern is intransitive, it does not pass,  
it moves but it stays in our field of vision. It arises from 
stillness, and I should like to think about the point at which 
stillness becomes motion. Another thing I should like to
think about is the point at which pattern becomes consciousness."

"When a pattern shows itself in tiles or on paper or in your mind 
and says, 'This is the mode of my repetition; in this manner I 
extend myself to infinity', it has already done so, it has 
already been infinite from the very first moment of its being; 
the potentiality and the actuality are one thing. If two and 
two can be four then they actually are four, you can only 
perceive it, you have no part in making it happen by writing 
it down in numbers or telling it out in pebbles."

We have learned to pass with such facility from cardinal to ordinal 
number that the two aspects appear to us as one. To determine the 
plurality of a collection, that is, its cardinal number, we do not 
bother anymore to find a model collection with which we can match 
it -- we count it. And to the fact that we have learned to identify 
the two aspects of number is due our progress in mathematics . . . 
The operations of arithmetic are based on the tacit assumption that 
we can always pass from any number to its successor, and this is 
the essence of  the ordinal concept.

And so matching by itself is incapable of creating an art of 
reckoning.  Without our ability to arrange things in ordered 
succession little progress could have been made. Correspondence 
and succession, the two principles that permeate all mathematics 
-- nay, all realms of exact thought -- are woven into the very 
fabric of our number system.

Mathematics never reveals man to the degree, never expresses him

the world injected its patterns into human language at the very 
inception of that language; mathematics sleeps in every utterance,

Some of the particulars recommended by Abulafia contributed to the 
aura of magic surrounding Kabbalah: the best hour for meditative 
permutations (known as tzeruf) was midnight. The meditator was to 
light many candles, wear phylacteries and a prayer shawl, and write 
out the permutations of the alphabet with ever increasing speed. 
The resulting ecstatic state accompanied by the desire of the soul 
to leave the body could be so powerful that there was even the 
possibility of death. At the peak of ecstatic experience there 
would be a rush of unintelligible language and the kabbalist had 
to envision a surrounding circle of angels who could help to 
decipher the divine message. It was the sheer force of the letters 
themselves which brought forth the meaning, since the only link 
between the Sephirot of non-verbal Wisdom and verbal Intelligence
was through the letters of the alphabet.

To spare themselves, the mathematicians farmed out 
the routine work to the "computers" -- a common 
reference to people who performed calculations. 
(Computers are not the only devices to have human 
antecedents. Later in the nineteenth century, 
"typewriter" referred to a person who typed rather 
than to the machine itself. It was not unheard of for 
the boss to elope with his typewriter.)

Babbage . . .  wrote to Herschel saying that . . . in a 
few years his completed engine would produce 
"logarithmic tables as cheap as potatoes".

<P ALIGN=CENTER>--oo--<P>

[Babbage] took the ergonomics of reading tables to 
extraordinary lengths, producing samples using 
every permutation of ink colour and backing paper 
including -- bizarrely it seems -- green ink on three 
shades of green paper. He was a mathematician and 
a logician, and a permutation is a permutation.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>--oo--<P>

From the start there has been a curious affinity 
between mathematics, mind and computing . . . It is 
perhaps no accident that Pascal and Leibniz in the 
seventeenth century, Babbage and George Boole in 
the nineteenth, and Alan Turing and John von Neumann 
in the twentieth -- seminal figures in the history of 
computing -- were all, among their other accomplishments, 
mathematicians, possessing a natural affinity for 
symbol, representation, abstraction and logic.

Yet it is by the laborious route of analysis that [the

While [Maynard Smith] believed that a Marxist in 
science could take a lot of different positions, he 
saw the need for "some kind of substitute for 
Hegelian dialectics . . . some kind of concept that in 
dynamical systems there are going to be sudden 
breaks and thresholds and transformations, and so 
on". He added that, in his opinion, "today we really 
do have a mathematics for thinking about complex 
systems and things which undergo transformations 
from quantity into quality". Here he saw Hopf 
bifurcations and catastrophe theory as really 
nothing other than a change of quantity into 
quality in a dialectical sense.

. . . the professors [at Bologna] were kept in absolute 
and even humiliating subservience to their students. 
They had to swear obedience to the student rectors and to 
the student-made statutes, which bore very hardly upon them,
e.g. the professor was fined if he began his teaching a minute 
late or continued a minute longer than the fixed time, and 
should this happen the students who failed to leave the 
lecture-room immediately were themselves fined. In addition, 
the professor was fined if he shirked explaining a difficult 
passage, or if he failed to get through the syllabus; he was 
fined if he left the city for a day without the rector's 
permission, and if he married, was allowed only one day off 
for the purpose. The city, for its part, took a hand in 
controlling the professors, and they were forced to take
an oath not to leave Bologna in search of more lucrative or 
less onerous posts.

Astrologers . . . were suspect because of their

had been besmirched by the assumption that mathematics
was part of the black art, and it was notorious that the
Edwardian reformers had destroyed mathematical manuscripts
at Oxford under the delusion that they were conjuring books.
"Where a red letter or a mathematical diagram appeared,
they were sufficient to entitle the book to be Popish or
diabolical." (This may account for the disappearance at
this period of nearly all the works of the fourteenth-
century Merton College school of astronomers.)

say that the building blocks of living organisms are few, 
modular, and combinatorial. Proteins comprise a few hundred 
protein structural domains; nucleic acids are simpler, with 
a few tens of structural domains and regulatory binding sites
for sequence-specific protein domains. The combinations of 
these elements are vastly larger than any universe we can 
comprehend, but a large proportion of these should work, when 
given familiar network architectures similar to those of 
existing organisms. Why waste time marking out the hyperspace 
of possibilities when we already know where the good stuff is?

It is obvious that mathematics needs both sorts of mathematicians
[theory-builders and problem-solvers] . . . It is equally obvious
that different branches of mathematics require different
aptitudes. In some, such as algebraic number theory, or the
cluster of subjects now known simply as Geometry, it seems . . .
to be important for many reasons to build up a considerable
expertise and knowledge of the work that other mathematicians
are doing, as progress is often the result of clever
combinations of a wide range of existing results. Moreover, if
one selects a problem, works on it in isolation for a few years 
and finally solves it, there is a danger, unless the problem is 
very famous, that it will no longer be regarded as all that
significant.<P>

At the other end of the spectrum is, for example, graph theory,
where the basic object, a graph, can be immediately comprehended.
One will not get anywhere in graph theory by sitting in an
armchair and trying to understand graphs better. Neither is it
particularly necessary to read much of the literature before 
tackling a problem: it is of course helpful to be aware of
some of the most important techniques, but the interesting 
problems tend to be open precisely because the established 
techniques cannot easily be applied.

Of the properties of mathematics, as a language, the most 
peculiar one is that by playing formal games with an input 
mathematical text, one can get an output text which seemingly 
carries new knowledge. The basic examples are furnished by 
scientific or technological calculations: general laws plus
initial conditions produce predictions, often only after 
time-consuming and computer-aided work. One can say that
the input contains an implicit knowledge which is thereby 
made explicit. One could try to find a parallel in the 
humanities by comparing this to hermeneutics: the art of 
finding hidden meanings of sacred texts. Legal discourse, 
too, has some common traits with scientific discourse. In 
the course of history, the modern language of science slowly 
emerged from these two archaic activities, and it still owes
a lot to them, especially in the more descriptive and less 
mathematicised domains.

First, I want to quote a definition of what is mathematics 
due to Davis and Hersh . . . "The study of mental objects 
with reproducible properties is called mathematics." I love 
this definition because it doesn't try to limit mathematics 
to what has been called mathematics in the past but really
attempts to say why certain communications are classified 
as math, others as science, others as art, others as gossip. 
Thus reproducible properties of the physical world are 
science whereas reproducible mental objects are math. Art
lives on the mental plane (the real painting is not the set 
of dry pigments on the canvas nor is a symphony the sequence 
of sound waves that convey it to our ear) but, as the 
post-modernists insist, is reinterpreted in new contexts
by each appreciator. As for gossip, which includes the vast 
majority of our thoughts, its essence is its relation to a 
unique local part of time and space.

For example, how significant it is that in the Indo-European languages, as
Darmsteter has pointed out, the root meaning "two" should connote badness.
The Greek prefix dys- (as in dyspepsia) and the Latin dis- (as in
dishonorable) are both derived from "duo". The cognate bis- gives a
pejorative sense to such modern French words as <I>b&eacute;vue</I>
("blunder", literally "two-sight"). Traces of that "second which leads you
