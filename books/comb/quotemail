Hi Peter,

Any luck tracing that quote?  Just last night I was talking with someone
else who thought they had encountered the same quote but couldn't quite
place it.

Best,
Clark

Dear Clark,

Thanks for your mail - it is good to know that somebody reads this!

I am currently at a conference which doesn't have any computing
facilities apart from web browsing, so I can't edit any files, look up
any references, etc. What I put up was taken from a notebook I kept when
I was an undergraduate (a very long time ago!). I cannot now remember
where I took it from. Wherever it was, it had a brief account of the
speech, which apparently went on for many hours, but I think this was
the only bit that was quoted. It is entirely possible that either I or
the author of the unknown book made various errors in the quote itself
or the attribution, who knows?

When I get back to London I will have a shot at finding the notebook and
looking for clues about where it may have come from.

Peter.

Peter,
=20
I've been reading your Mathematical Quotes - with great interest.  There
is one which prompts me to write to you.  The quote follows:
=20
"In the pure mathematics we contemplate absolute truths, which existed
in the Divine Mind before the morning stars sang together, and which
will continue to exist when the last of their radiant host shall have
fallen from heaven."
=20
The attritution is "E. Everett, speech at Gettysberg, 1865."
=20
I wasn't able to find an 1865 speech at Gettysberg but did find an 1863
speech at Gettysburg (with -burg in place of -berg).  Assuming this
latter was the right speech, a search of the text at
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Oration did not find the quote.
=20
Any ideas for finding a copy of the speech that contains the quote?
=20
Thanks!
