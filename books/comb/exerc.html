<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Combinatorial exercises</H1>

These exercises are a very mixed bag in terms of subject and difficulty!

1. Let <I>n</I> and <I>k</I> be given non-negative
integers. Consider all strictly increasing sequences of <I>k</I> integers
in the range 1..<I>n</I>. For each sequence, multiply all its members
together, and then add all these products. Call the result <I>A</I>(<I>n,k</I>).
Now do the same for all weakly increasing sequences, and call the result
<I>B</I>(<I>n,k</I>). Both <I>A</I>(<I>n,k</I>) and <I>B</I>(<I>n,k</I>)
are Stirling numbers: the question is, which ones?

2. Let <I>P</I> and <I>Q</I> be the two tableaux of the same shape
corresponding to the permutation <I>g</I> under the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth
correspondence. Prove that the length of the first row of <I>P</I> and <I>Q</I>
is equal to the longest increasing subsequence of <I>g</I>.

<P>

* Can you find an interpretation of the length of the first column of
<I>P</I> and <I>Q</I>?

3. If you have lunch in the sandwich bar described below five days a week,
fifty weeks a year, how long could you go without repeating an order?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The miserable wasteland of multidimensional space was first brought home 
to me in one gruesome solo lunch hour in one of MIT's sandwich
shops. "Wholewheat, rye, multigrain, sourdough or bagel? Toasted, one 
side or two? Both halves toasted, one side or two? Butter,
polyunsaturated margarine, cream cheese or hoummus? Pastrami, salami, 
lox, honey cured ham or Canadian bacon? Aragula, iceberg,
romaine, cress or alfalfa? Swiss, American, cheddar, mozzarella, 
or blue? Tomato, gherkin, cucumber, onion? Wholegrain, French, English or
American mustard? Ketchup, piccalilli, tabasco, soy sauce? Here or to go?"

Future of Genomes</I> by Adrian Woolfson, in the Balliol College

4. A car park has <I>n</I> spaces, numbered from 1 to <I>n</I>,
arranged in a row. <I>n</I> drivers each independently choose
a favourite parking space in the park. As each driver enters the
park, he drives to his favourite space. If it is empty, he parks
there. Otherwise, he continues along the line and parks in the
first free space. If all spaces between his favourite and
<I>n</I> are taken, he leaves in disgust.
<UL>
<LI> Show that, out of the <I>n<SUP>n</SUP></I> choices of favourite spaces
that the drivers can make, just (<I>n</I>+1)<SUP>(<I>n</I>-1)</SUP> lead to all
drivers parking successfully.
<LI> This is the number of labelled trees on <I>n</I>+1 vertices.
What is the connection?

5. The following algorithm for constructing a magic square of order divisible
by 4 was given by Ibn Qunfudh in the 14th century, in his book
<I>Lifting the Veil from the Operations of Calculation</I>.
The case <I>n</I>=4 is illustrated.

6. The following problem arises in the theory of clinical trials.
<P>
A new drug is to be tested out. Of 2<I>n</I> subjects in the trial, 
<I>n</I> will receive the new drug and <I>n</I> will get a placebo. 
To avoid bias, it is important that the doctor administering the 
treatments does not know, and cannot reliably guess, which treatment 
each patient receives. The patients enter the trial one at a
time, and are numbered from 1 to 2<I>n</I>.
<P>
If the treatments were allocated randomly with probability 1/2, the doctor's
guesses could be no better than random (so that the expected values for the
numbers of correct and incorrect guesses are both <I>n</I>); but then the 
numbers of patients receiving drug and placebo would be unlikely to be equal. 
Given that they must balance, the doctor can certainly guess at least the last
patient's treatment correctly.
<P>
If we allocated the drug and the placebo randomly to patients 2<I>i</I>-1 and 
2<I>i</I> for <I>i</I>=1,...,<I>n</I>, then the doctor can correctly guess 
the treatment for each even-numbered patient.
<P>
Suppose that instead we choose a random set of <I>n</I> patients to allocate 
the drug to, and the remaining <I>n</I> get the placebo; each of the 
<SUP>2<I>n</I></SUP>C<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> sets
is equally likely. Suppose also that the doctor
guesses according to the following rule. If the number of patients
so far having the drug and the placebo are equal, he guesses at random about
the next treatment. If the drug has occurred more often than the placebo, he
guesses that the next treatment is the placebo, and vice versa if the
placebo has occurred more often than the drug.
<P>
Find a formula, and an asymptotic estimate, for the expected value of the
difference between the number of correct guesses and the number of incorrect
guesses that the doctor makes.
