Dear Peter,

Thanks for clarifying the Sperner argument for me.  I didn't think of
using what we'd proved in the first half.

Here's a list of errata.  There aren't very many and the wonderful
style of presentation far outweighs these small errors.  In this 
list p/l (resp p//l)  is line l from the top (resp bottom) of page p.
Also A <- B means A should be replaced by B.

See you at a conference sometime!

Dear Peter,

I realized that my erratum on page 110 is itself in error!  Ignore it.
And I've found another one.  On page 111, 3 of the lines are missing
from the figure of the STS(9), namely the ones of the form c_i,c_j,a_k.

All the best, Bruce

Dear Peter,

It was brought to my attention in class today that in order for
Theorem 8.1.2 to be true for n=3 you need to allow n=m, while on page
107 you insist that n>m.  It's a minor point, but there is nothing
wrong with allowing n=m=l.

Dear Peter,

Below is the latest list.  I also have a question about your proof of
Fact 2 in the Bruck-Ryser Theorem.  It seems you never use the fact
that p is an odd prime in the 2-square case.  But I suspect it is
necessary for the 4-square case since I don't see how to get s<r by
using the same argument as for 2 squares.  But this is also puzzling
since I don't see how knowing something about p gives you any control
over r.  Can you please indicate where you need p an odd prime and how
you get s<r for 4 squares?  Thanks!

All the best, Bruce

Dear Peter,

Below is the latest list of errata.  I have also come up against an
incorrect proof that I have not been able to fix and would appreciate
it if you could tell me how to do it correctly.  In your proof that
partial transversals form a matroid (on page 204, part 4), you take
transversals Y,Z with |Y|<|Z| and then consider the sets A_y indexed
by the elements of y and a set B_z indexed by some element of Z.
You then look at X'=Y U z and consider the restrictions of the sets
A_y and B_z to X'.  You then claim that if these sets have an SDR,
then we are done as X' is an SDR of the original family.  This is
false.  What if z is not in Y but B_z = B_y for some y.  Then an SDR
of the restrictions does not lift to a transversal of the original
sets since two of the restrictions correspond to only one of the
originals.  You can fix this by only considering the case when B_z does
not equal any A_y.  But then the second part of your proof goes awry,
as we can only conclude that such z are in Y, not that Z is contained
in Y, and so get no contradiction.  HELP!

Dear Peter,

Here are yet more errata.  There are also some logical difficulties.

In the proof of Proposition 10.4.3, it seems you could get a better
bound of 2^{(l-1)/2} for l>=2 as follows.  You get the count of
{n choose l} 2/2^{l choose 2} as before and then use l!>=2 and
n(n-1)...(n-l+1)<n^l to get that this is bounded above by
n^l/2^{l choose 2} and now the better bound works.

On page 193, to show that a bijection s of lattices is an
isomorphism, it suffices to prove either that s preserves meet or
join.  You need not do both.  To see this, use the equivalent
definition that s and s^{-1} should be order preserving.  Assume just
that s preserves join.  Then if a <= b we have a v b = b so
s(b) = s(a v b) = s(a) v s(b) so s(a) <= s(b).  On the other hand,
if s(a) <= s(b) then s(b) = s(a) v s(b) = s(a v b) so b = a v b
by injectivity and a <= b.

On the same page, do you really want the first bulleted statement in
the definition of complementation?  It is not in the definitions I've
seen (eg in Stanley's text) and you don't use it in the proof of 12.3.3.

All the best, Bruce

143/7	Exercise 12 <- Exercise 13

148//9	division by n <- division by q

153	Proposition 10.4.3 can be strengthened to (l-1)/2 in the exponent
	and for l >= 2

189	In the lattice of subspaces example, PG(n,q) <- PG(n-1,q)

193	In Step 5, one of (a) or (b) suffices

193	The first bulleted line in the definition of complementation 
	is not needed
