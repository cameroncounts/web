This collection is a miscellany in Littlewood's sense (see his definition
under <a href="#misc">Miscellany</a> below). The quotes are almost all derived
from my own reading, though a few are culled from dictionaries or have been
sent to me by others. I have organised them under several headings (see above)
with a few cross-links. I have also tried to put similar or complementary
quotes together, so if you are led to one quote, scan the others around it.
(See the pair by Noam Chomsky and Thetis Blacker, towards the end of Miscellany,
those by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and Robert Louis Stevenson also in Miscellany,
those by Francis Bacon and Nicholas Hawksmoor on the scientific method in
Miscellany,
those by Dante Alighieri and Nicole Oresme at the start of Probability and
Statistics, the three quotes on mathematics and conjuring or astrology at
the end of History, or the quotes by Galileo and Mandelbrot in Geometry,
for example.)

<p>
Definitions from Samuel Johnson's <i>Dictionary of the English Language</i>
(1755). Johnson took many of these from John Harris (1667&ndash;1719) or 
Ephraim Chambers (c.1680&ndash;1740). I have used the edition by Jack Lynch 
(Levenger Press 2004).

<dt>mathematicks</dt>
<dd> That science which contemplates whatever is capable of being numbered or
measured; and it is either pure or mixt: pure considers abstracted quantity,
without any relation to matter; mixt is interwoven with physical
considerations.</dd>
<dt>logick</dt>
<dd> The art of reasoning.</dd>
<dt>arithmetick<dt>
<dd> The science of numbers; the art of computation.</dd>
<dt>algebra</dt>
<dd>This is a peculiar kind of arithmetick, which takes the quantity sought,
whether it be a number or a line, or any other quantity, as if it were
granted, and by means of one or more quantities given, proceeds by
consequence, till the quantity at first only supposed to be known, or at
least some power thereof, is found to be equal to some quantity or quantities
which are known, and consequently itself is known.</dd>
<dt>geometry</dt>
<dd> Originally signifies the art of measuring the earth, or any distances or
dimensions on or within it: but it is now used for the science of quantity,
extension, or magnitude abstractedly considered, without any regard to
matter.</dd>
<dt>trigonometry</dt>
<dd> Trigonometry is the art of measuring triangles, or of calculating the
sides of any triangle sought, and this is plane or spherical.</dd>

<dt>differential method<dt>
<dd>is applied to the doctrine of infinitesimals, or infinitely small
quantities, called the arithmetick of fluxions; about the invention of which
there has been a contest between Leibnitz and Sir Isaac Newton. It consists
in descending from whole quantities to their infinitely small differences,
and comparing together these infinitely small differences, of what kind
soever they be: and from thence it takes the name of the differential
calculus, or analysis of infinitesimals.</dd>

I found, that in Germany they were engaged in a species of political
enquiry, to which they had given the name of Statistics; though I apply
a different idea to that word, for by Statistics is meant in Germany, an
inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the political strength of a 
country, or questions respecting matters of state; whereas, the idea I
annex to the term, is an inquiry into the state of a country, for the
purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its
inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement.

<a name="proof"><h2>Proofs</h2></a>

A fine collection of quotations about proof in mathematics, assembled by
David Lingard, appears in the <i>BSHM Bulletin</i> <b>1</b> (2004),
63&ndash;66. I can't find them on the Web, but here, as a sample, are two
conflicting views from Riemann and Gauss, quoted by Imre Lakatos in
<i>Proofs and Refutations</i>:
<blockquote>
<p>
Georg Bernhard Riemann: "If only I had the theorems! Then I should find the 
proofs easily enough."
</p>
<p>
Karl Friedrich Gauss: "I have had my results for a long time, but I do not 
yet know how to arrive at them."
</p>

<p>
A non-symbolic argument or proof can be quite rigorous when given
for a particular value of the variable; the conditions for rigor 
are that the particular value of the variable should be typical, 
and that a further generalization to any value should be immediate.

</blockquote>

<p>
Proof, being the highest level of reproduction activity, has an important 
interiorization aspect: as Yuri Manin stresses in his book <em>Provable and 
Unprovable</em>, a proof becomes such only after it is <em>accepted</em> (as 
the result of a highly rigorous process) [...] Manin describes the act of 
acceptance as a social act; however, the importance of its personal, 
psychological component can hardly be overestimated.

I think it is said that Gauss had ten different proofs for the law of
quadratic reciprocity. Any good theorem should have several proofs, the more
the better. For two reasons: usually, different proofs have different strengths
and weaknesses, and they generalise in different directions &mdash; they are
not just repetitions of each other.

<p>
Mathematics, however, is, as it were, its own explanation; this, although it
may seem hard to accept, is nevertheless true, for the recognition that a
fact is so is the cause upon which we base the proof.

<p>
Lefschetz valued independent thinking and originality above
everything. He was, in fact, contemptuous of elegant or rigorous
proofs of what he considered obvious points. He once dismissed a
clever new proof of one of this theorems by saying, "Don't come to me
with your pretty proofs. We don't bother with that baby stuff around
here." Legend had it that he never wrote a correct proof or stated an
incorrect theorem. His first comprehensive treatise on topology, a
highly influential book in which he coined the term "algebraic
topology," "hardly contains one completely correct proof. It was
rumored that it had been written during one of Lefschetz'
sabbaticals&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when his students did not have the
opportunity to revise it."

The proof [of the existence of an infinity of prime numbers] is by
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, and <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, which Euclid
loved so much, is one of a mathematician's favourite weapons. It is a far
finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of
a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers <i>the game</i>.

Cardinal arithmetic will be quite important for us, so we spend some time on
it. Since, however, it tends to be trivial, we shall not need to spend much
of this time on <i>proofs</i>.

[Christopher] Hansteen declared that proofs should not be used in elementary
teaching before it was necessary because, he argued, it invited students to
memorize without understanding. To this, [Michael] Holmboe replied that one
either has to prove all or nothing, as half a proof is worse than no proof.

<a name="axio"><h2>Axioms</h2></a>

<p>
A choice of axioms is not purely a subjective task. It is usually
expected to achieve some definite aim &mdash; some specific theorem or
theorems are to be derivable from the axioms &mdash; and to this extent 
the problem is exact and objective. But beyond this there are 
always other important desiderata of a less exact nature: the
axioms should not be too numerous, their system is to be as simple
and transparent as possible, and each axiom should have an 
immediate intuitive meaning by which its appropriateness can be 
judged directly.
</p>

Economic Behavior</i>, Princeton University Press, 1944.

<p>
To illustrate the strong feelings of independence which, as a part of the
old traditions, are so characteristic of the English spirit, I should like
to tell how Hardy and Littlewood, when they planned and began their
far-reaching and intensive team work, still had some misgivings about it
because they feared that it might encroach on their personal freedom,
so vitally important to them. Therefore, as a safety measure, 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they amused themselves by formulating some so-called 'axioms'
for their mutual collaboration. There were in all four such axioms.
</p>

<p>
The first of them said that, when one wrote to the other, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,
it was completely indifferent whether what they wrote was right or wrong
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
The second axiom was to the effect that, when one received a letter from
the other, he was under no obligation whatsoever to read it, let alone
to answer it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
The third axiom was to the effect that, although it did not really matter
if they both thought about the same detail, still, it was preferable that
they should not do so.
</p>

<p>
And, finally, the fourth, and perhaps most important axiom, stated that it
was quite indifferent if one of them had not contributed the least bit to
the contents of a paper under their common name .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
I think one may safely say that seldom &mdash; or never &mdash; was such an
important and harmonious collaboration founded on such apparently negative
axioms.

The method of "postulating" what we want has many advantages; they are the
same as the advantages of theft over honest toil. Let us leave them to others
and proceed with our honest toil.

London, 1919.

<p>
"Ignorance of axioms", the Lecturer continued, "is a great drawback in life.
It wastes so much time to have to say them over and over again. For instance,
take the Axiom, '<i>Nothing is greater than itself</i>,' that is, 
'<i>Nothing can contain itself</i>.' How often you hear people say 'He was so
excited, he was quite unable to contain himself.' Why, <i>of course</i> he was
unable! The <i>excitement</i> had nothing to do with it!"
</p>

Lewis Carroll, <i>Sylvie and Bruno Concluded</i>.

<hr>

<p>
To solve the problem of what is mathematical truth, Poincar&eacute; said,
we should first ask ourselves what is the nature of geometric axioms. Are
they synthetic <i>a priori</i> judgments, as Kant said? That is, do they 
exist as a fixed part of man's consciousness, independently of experience
and uncreated by experience? Poincar&eacute; thought not. They would then
impose themselves on us with such force that we couldn't conceive the
contrary proposition, or build upon it a theoretic edifice. There would
be no non-Euclidean geometry.
</p>
<p>
Should we therefore conclude that the axioms of geometry are eternal verities?
Poincar&eacute; didn't think that was so either. If they were, they would be
subject to continual change and revision as new laboratory data came in. This
seemed to be contrary to the whole nature of geometry itself.
</p>
<p>
Poincar&eacute; concluded that the axioms of geometry are <i>conventions</i>,
our choice among all possible conventions is <i>guided</i> by experimental
facts, but it remains <i>free</i> and is limited only by the necessity of
avoiding all contradiction. Thus it is that the postulates can remain
rigorously true even though the experimental laws that have determined their
adoption are only approximative. The axioms of geometry, in other words, are
merely disguised definitions.

[A bit of background: infinite group theorists say that a group <i>G</i> is
<i>virtually P</i>, where <i>P</i> is some group-theoretic property, if
<i>G</i> has a subgroup of finite index which has property <i>P</i>. This
enables them to wind up finite group theorists by saying that they study
groups which are virtually trivial.]

possibility of a "Big Universe". These included ... Kant's <i>Universal 
Natural History of the Heavens</i> (1755), which first proposed &ndash; though

in some sense "infinite", though it is not clear what exactly "infinite"
might mean, as hitherto it was a quality possessed only by God and
mathematics.

The man who has learned that three plus one are four doesn't have to go

plus one can be two, or fourteen, then reason is madness.

<p>
We have learned to pass with such facility from cardinal to ordinal 
number that the two aspects appear to us as one. To determine the 
plurality of a collection, that is, its cardinal number, we do not 
bother anymore to find a model collection with which we can match 
it &mdash; we count it. And to the fact that we have learned to identify 
the two aspects of number is due our progress in mathematics . . . 
The operations of arithmetic are based on the tacit assumption that 
we can always pass from any number to its successor, and this is 
the essence of  the ordinal concept.
</p>

<p>
And so matching by itself is incapable of creating an art of 
reckoning.  Without our ability to arrange things in ordered 
succession little progress could have been made. Correspondence 
and succession, the two principles that permeate all mathematics 
&mdash; nay, all realms of exact thought &mdash; are woven into the very 
fabric of our number system.

For example, how significant it is that in the Indo-European languages, as
Darmsteter has pointed out, the root meaning "two" should connote badness.
The Greek prefix dys- (as in dyspepsia) and the Latin dis- (as in
dishonorable) are both derived from "duo". The cognate bis- gives a
pejorative sense to such modern French words as <i>b&eacute;vue</i>
("blunder", literally "two-sight"). Traces of that "second which leads you
astray" can be found in "dubious", "doubt", and <i>Zweifel</i> &mdash; for to
doubt is to be double-minded. Bunyan has his Mr. Facing-both-ways, and modern
American slang its "two-timers". Obscurely and unconsciously wise, our
language confirms the findings of the mystics and proclaims  the essential
badness of division &mdash; a word, incidentally, in which our old enemy
"two"makes another decisive appearance.

There are so many things you can do to a number, and as many reasons why
you might want to. Add it, subtract it, cube it, expose it to all the
contortions of mathematics. You could even, long ago, count things with it.
But you couldn't steal it. But then again, you wouldn't have wanted to.
</p>

<p>
Times change, and there is a new mathematics of number. In the new mathematics,
the digits themselves, though crucial, no longer convey the number's value.
In this new order, a small four-digit number, though numerically inferior in
all respects to an infinite number of numbers above it, may be much more
valuable.
</p>

<p>
A PIN, for example &mdash; an access code, the power to get wealth or credit
or information &mdash; is worth many times more than the 11-digit telephone
number of a pizza delivery outlet, even one that claims to use real
mozzarella. The new situation is that a number's true value can no longer be
separated from its place in the world.
</p>

<p>
So the new mathematics, that is, the useful mathematics, has a calculus quite
different from its predecessor. It still has ordering functions, and the 
concept of value but the number line has become a cloud of shifting points,
tied up almost unfathomably with the world in which they exist.

Augustine took from the Neoplatonists that interest in number, which to the
ordinary reader of his works seems an idiosyncrasy. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Plato,
influenced by the Pythagoreans, tended towards the end of his life to see
the ideal world&mdash;reality&mdash;as made up of mathematical concepts and
symbols, which were therefore the metaphysical constituents of the visible
universe. Plotinus adopted the conception, probably from the
Neo-Pythagoreans, and Augustine in turn took it from the Neoplatonists.
For him number is the intelligible formula which describes the qualities
of being and the manner of change, so that all chage throughout the universe,
which presents so much philosophical difficulty, can in a sense be 'controlled'
by numbers, just as an algebraic formula might express an electrical
transformation or an engineering stress. Numbers are, in fact, a
rationalization of the seminal reason of things. Numbers as used by Augustine
had, of course, no scientific or mathematical basis, and it was easy, as
Augustine found, to allegorize them, but the rational, or at least the
pseudo-rational, foundation for what seems to many to be a strange aberration
of a great genius can be seen to be one more legacy from Neoplatonism.

The idea that area and volume would be discrete had come to me in a flash as I was trying to calculate the volume of some quantum geometry, while I was sitting for an hour in a noisy room in a garage waiting for my car to be fixed. The page of my notebook was filled with many messy integrals, but all of a sudden I saw emerge a formula for counting. I had begun to calculate a quantity on the assumption that the result was a real number, but found instead that, in certain units, all the possible answers would be integers. This meant that areas and volumes cannot take any value, but come in multiples of fixed units.

feared that some day the number of musical combinations would be

toyed with the staggering fantasy of a universal library which

Some of the particulars recommended by Abulafia contributed to the 
aura of magic surrounding Kabbalah: the best hour for meditative 
permutations (known as tzeruf) was midnight. The meditator was to 
light many candles, wear phylacteries and a prayer shawl, and write 
out the permutations of the alphabet with ever increasing speed. 
The resulting ecstatic state accompanied by the desire of the soul 
to leave the body could be so powerful that there was even the 
possibility of death. At the peak of ecstatic experience there 
would be a rush of unintelligible language and the kabbalist had 
to envision a surrounding circle of angels who could help to 
decipher the divine message. It was the sheer force of the letters 
themselves which brought forth the meaning, since the only link 
between the Sephirot of non-verbal Wisdom and verbal Intelligence
was through the letters of the alphabet.

nothing other than a change of quantity into

a few tens of structural domains and regulatory binding sites

these elements are vastly larger than any universe we can 
comprehend, but a large proportion of these should work, when 
given familiar network architectures similar to those of 
existing organisms. Why waste time marking out the hyperspace

Reasoning and logic are to each other as health is to medicine, or &mdash; 
better &mdash; as conduct is to morality. Reasoning refers to a gamut of 
natural thought processes in the everyday world. Logic is how we 
ought to think if objective truth is our goal &mdash; and the everyday 
world is very little concerned with objective truth. Logic is the 
science of the justification of conclusions we have reached by 
natural reasoning. My point here is that, for such natural 
reasoning to occur, consciousness is not necessary. The very 
reason we need logic at all is because most reasoning is not 
conscious at all.

was making a name for himself. One term I happened to lecture in the
same classroom, the hour immediately after he did. Each day, before
erasing the blackboard, I would take a look to see what he was up to.
Well, in September he started out with Theorem 1. Shortly before
Christmas he was up to Theorem 747. You know what it was? 'If 
<i>x</i>&#8804;<i>y</i> and <i>y</i>&#8804;<i>z</i>, then

That this is the real meaning of "Ockham's razor" can be gathered from various
texts in Ockham's writings. It is quite often stated by Ockham in the form:
"Plurality is not to be posited without necessity" (<i>Pluralitas non est
ponenda sine necessitate</i>), and also, though seldom: "What can be explained
by the assumption of fewer things is vainly explained by the assumption of more
things" (<i>Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora</i>). The form
usually given, "Entities must not be multiplied without necessity" (<i>Entia
non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate</i>), does not seem to have been used
by Ockham. What Ockham demands in his maxim is that everyone who makes a
statement must have a sufficient reason for its truth ... This principle of
"sufficient reason" is epistemological or methodological, certainly not an
ontological axiom.

Borel's interest in set theory began with what he at first called a
"romantic attraction", although like many such attractions, it would later
cool. Borel subsequently excused this early fascination with set theory by
observing, 
"Like many of the young mathematicians, I had been immediately captivated by
the Cantorian theory; I don't regret it in the least, for that is one mental
exercise that truly opens up the mind."

<a name="cats"><h2>Category theory</h2></a>

<p>
The standard "foundation" for mathematics starts with sets and
their elements. It is possible to start differently, by axiomatising
not elements of sets but functions between sets. This can be done
by using the language of categories and universal constructions.
</p>

<p align="center">--oo--</p>

<p>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in one sense a foundation is a security blanket: If you
meticulously follow the rules laid down, no paradoxes or
contradictions will arise. In reality there is now no guarantee
of this sort of security .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p align="center">--oo--</p>

<p>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the membership relation for sets can often be replaced by the
composition operation for functions. This leads to an alternative 
foundation for Mathematics upon categories &mdash; specifically, on 
the category of all functions. Now much of Mathematics is dynamic, 
in that it deals with morphisms of an object into another object 
of the same kind. Such morphisms (like functions) form categories, 
and so the approach via categories fits well with the objective 
of organizing and understanding Mathematics. That, in truth, 
should be the goal of a proper philosophy of Mathematics.

Nowadays, one of the most interesting points in mathematics is that, although 
all categorical reasonings are formally contradictory, we use them and we 
never make a mistake. Grothendieck provided a partial foundation in terms of 
universes but a revolution of the foundations similar to what Cauchy and 
Weierstrass did for analysis is still to arrive. In this respect, he was 
pragmatic: categories are useful and they give results so we do not have to 
look at subtle set-theoretic questions if there is no need. Is today the 
moment to think about these problems? Maybe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Category theory is intended as a universal language of mathematics, so all
concepts should be translated into it. Much as beavers, who as a species hate
the sound of running water, plaster a creek with mud and sticks until alas
that cursed tinkle stops, so do category theorists devise elaborate and 
obscure definitions in an attempt to capture a concept that to most of us
seemed perfectly clear before they got to it. But at least sometimes this
works admirably &ndash; for instance no one can be immune to the charm of
treating knot invariants with braided monoidal categories.

This generality of course comes with a price: it can wash away all of the
endearing special features of a favourite theory or structure. There certainly
are contexts where, for example, all human beings should be considered equal,
but there are other contexts where the given human is none other than your
mother and must be treated as such.

There is a very famous joke about Bose's work in Giridh. Professor
Mahalanobis wanted Bose to visit the paddy fields and advise him on sampling
problems for the estimation of yield of paddy. Bose did not very much like
the idea, and he used to spend most of the time at home working on
combinatorial problems using Galois fields. The workers of the ISI used to
make a joke about this. Whenever Professor Mahalanobis asked about Bose, his
secretary would say that Bose is working in fields, which kept the Professor
happy.

The method of the physical sciences is based upon the induction which leads
us to expect the recurrence of a phenomenon when the circumstances which give
rise to it are repeated. If all the circumstances could be simultaneously
reproduced, this principle could be fearlessly applied; but this never
happens; some of the circumstances will always be missing. Are we absolutely
certain that they are unimportant? Evidently not! It may be probable, but it
cannot be rigorously certain. Hence the importance of the r&ocirc;le that is
played in the physical sciences by the law of probability. The calculus of
probabilities is therefore not merely a recreation, or a guide to the
baccarat player; and we must thoroughly examine the principles on which it is
based.

We would not go so far as to say that the passion with which these young
Russian students thought day and night about mathematical questions was
unique; the same passion could be found in the corridors of mathematics
departments in Cambridge, Bonn, Berkeley, Paris, and elsewhere. One
characteristic of the Russian approach, however, stood out &mdash; the
conviction of the best Russian teachers of mathematics that the most
fruitful attack on problems was direct and straightforward, without any
preliminary, long, heavy readings. In other words, <i>start from scratch</i>.
By doing so, one got an almost physical feeling of being directly in contact
with mathematical objects and experienced the sensual pleasure of having to
fight intellectually with one's bare hands. One of the great mathematicians
of the time, Israel Moissevich Gelfand, would tell his young students,
"We should study this topic before it has been tainted by handling."

And in fact it happens that whenever reason is wanting, men cry out against
each other, which does not happen with certainties. For this reason we
shall say that where the cry of controversy is heard there is no true
science, because the truth has a single end and when this is published,
argument is destroyed forever. But true sciences are those which, impelled
by hope, have been penetrated by the senses so that the tongues of
argument are silenced. They are not nourished on the dreams of investigators,
but proceed in orderly sequence from the first true and established
principles through successive stages to the end; as is shown by the
elements of mathematics. That is to say, number, measure, called arithmetic
and geometry, which with complete truth treat of quantities both
discontinuous and continuous. In them one does not argue if twice three
makes more or less than six, or that the angles of a triangle are less than
the sum of two right angles: all argument is reduced to eternal silence,
and those who are devoted to them can enjoy them with peace which the lying
sciences of the mind can never attain.

They had to swear obedience to the student rectors and to

should this happen the students who failed to leave the

the professor was fined if he shirked explaining a difficult 
passage, or if he failed to get through the syllabus; he was 
fined if he left the city for a day without the rector's 
permission, and if he married, was allowed only one day off 
for the purpose. The city, for its part, took a hand in 
controlling the professors, and they were forced to take
an oath not to leave Bologna in search of more lucrative or

I wanted to represent these [Fuchsian] functions by the quotient of two
series; the idea was perfectly conscious and deliberate; the analogy with
elliptic functions guided me. I asked myself what properties these series
must have if they existed, and succeeded without difficulty in forming the
series I have called thetafuchsian.

<p>
Just at this time, I left Caen, where I was living, to go on a geologic
excursion under the auspices of the School of Mines. The incidents of travel
made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an
omnibus to go to some place or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the
step the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to
have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the
Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. I did
not verify the idea; I should not have had time, as, upon taking my seat in
the omnibus, I went on with a conversation already commenced, but I felt a
perfect certainty. On my return to Caen, for conscience's sake I verified the
result at my leisure.
</p>

<p>
Then I turned my attention to the study of some arithmetical questions
apparently without much success and without a suspicion of any connection
with my preceding researches. Disgusted with my failure, I went to spend a
few days at the seaside and thought of something else. One morning, walking
on the bluff, the idea came to me, with just the same characteristics of
brevity, suddenness and immediate certainty, that the arithmetic
transformations of indefinite ternary quadratic forms were identical with
those of non-Euclidean geometry.

Perhaps I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of a
journey through a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room of the
mansion and it's completely dark. You stumble around bumping into furniture,
but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally after six
months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it's
all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the
next room and spend another six months in the dark. So each of these
breakthroughs, while sometimes they're momentary, sometimes over a period of
a day or two, they are the culmination of &mdash; and couldn't exist without
&mdash; the many months of stumbling around in the dark that preceded them.

At first I supposed that I should be able to overcome the contradiction quite
easily, and that probably there was some trivial error in the reasoning. 
Gradually, however, it became clear that this was not the case .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Throughout the latter half of 1901 I supposed the solution would be easy, but
by the end of that time  I had concluded that it was a big job .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I made a practice of wandering about the common room every night from eleven
until one, by which time I came to know the three different noises made by
nightjars. (Most people only know one.) I was trying hard to solve the
contradiction. Every morning I would sit down before a blank sheet of paper.
Throughout the day, with a brief interval for lunch, I would stare at the blank
sheet. Often when evening came it was still empty.

It was at St Leonards, probably because it was a boarding school, that I
discovered and developed as a positive habit the powers of what I call
"subliminal learning". We kept very regular hours and were never tired or
stressed at school. Lights out at 9p.m., even when in the sixth form. Out of
bed at 7a.m. The accepted wisdom is that one should relax before  going to
bed, emptying the mind of problems. As far as mathematics is concerned I
could not agree less. We looked forward to "drawing-room" each evening, but I
usually cheated and stole ten minutes back at my desk before bathtime. I
would make certain to sort out in my head, as late as possible, what problems
needed to be solved the next day and what might be usefully committed to
memory. Before falling asleep, I "drew" with my finger any relevant
geometrical figure or algebraic equation on the partitioning of the dormitory
cubicle that formed a bedside wall. The result would be miraculous. Without
fail, on waking in the morning, the details, the logical argument required or
the facts that I needed to recall were clearly imprinted in my mind and,
because of the clarity, any required solution would often be clearly
"written" on the partition. For this to work, it is essential to make sure to
wake at least five or ten minutes before the prescribed time for getting out
of bed, giving oneself time to go over what has been resolved while asleep.
This became honed to a fine art, without my ever telling anyone, and I have
used the technique deliberately ever since.

There is a strong parallel between mountain climbing and mathematics
research. When first attempts on a summit are made, the struggle is to find
any route. Once on the top, other possible routes up may be discerned and
sometimes a safer or shorter route can be chosen for the descent or for
subsequent ascents. In mathematics the challenge is finding a proof in the
first place. Once found, almost any competent mathematician can usually find
an alternative often much better and shorter proof. At least in
mountaineering we know that the mountain is there and that, if we can find a
way up and reach the summit, we shall triumph. In mathematics we do not
always know that there is a result, or if the proposition is only a figment
of the imagination, let alone whether a proof can be found.

Mathematics is a hard thing to love. It has the unfortunate habit, like a
rude dog, of turning its most unfavourable side towards you when you first
make contact with it. That unfavourable side is arithmetic, and most people
never really get the legacy of that initial encounter off their fingers
&mdash; which is where counting starts, and for most, where it remains.
Perhaps such an unwelcoming exterior serves a useful purpose &mdash; it
deters casual visitors from stumbling into the awesome discoveries that lie
beyond. Mathematics: you can get lost in such a beautiful place; unlike the
real world, it has a purity that makes even simulated reality seem grubby;
it is devoid of arbitrary construction in the same way the real world used
to be, before peole learned to tear natural things down and throw unnatural
things up. It is the best wilderness in which to retreat, to fast, to search
for enlightenment. It is, paradoxically, about the only place where you can
really take refuge from the modern world's unrelenting barrage of numbers.
But only mathematicians, and the various subspecies and half-breeds thereof,
go there, which might be another reason why it is so  unpopular with almost
everyone else.

We were to found a University magazine. A pair of little, active
brothers&mdash;Livingstone by name, great skippers on the foot, great
rubbers of the hands, who kept a book-shop over against the University
building&mdash;had been debauched to play the part of publishers. We four
were to be conjuct editors and, what was the main point of the concern, to
print our own works; while, by every rule of arithmetic&mdash;that flatterer
of credulity&mdash;the adventure must succeed and bring great profit. Well,
well&nbsp;: it was a bright vision.

The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the 
reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. 
But the bee takes the middle course: it gathers its material from the 
flowers of the garden and field, but transforms and digests it by a power of 
its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy (science); for
it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it 
take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical 
experiments and lay up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it 
up in the understanding altered and disgested. Therefore, from a closer 
and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the 
rational (such as has never been made), much may be hoped.

You can see [the meaning of the statement that "Literature is a living art"]
most easily and clearly, perhaps, by contrasting Science and Art at their two
extremes &mdash; say Pure Mathematics and Acting. Science as a rule deals with
things, Art with man's thought and emotion about things. In Pure Mathematics
things are rarefied into ideas, numbers, concepts, but still further and
further away from the individual man. Two and two make four, and fourpence is
not ninepence (or at any rate four is not nine) whether Alcibiades or Cleon
keep the tally. In Acting on the other hand almost everything depends on
personal interpretation &mdash; on the gesture, the walk, the gaze, the tone of
a Siddons, the <i>rus&eacute;</i> smile of a Coquelin, the exquisite, vibrant
intonation of a Bernhardt. 'English Art?' exclaimed Whistler, 'there is no
such thing! Art is art and mathematics is mathematics.' Whistler erred.
Precisely because Art is Art, and Mathematics is Mathematics and a Science,
Art being Art can be English or French; and more than this, must be the
personal expression of an Englishman or a Frenchman, as a 'Constable' differs
from a 'Corot' and a 'Whistler' from both.

The arts, like arithmetic and geometry, turn away their eyes from the
gross, coloured and mobile nature at our feet, and regard instead a certain
figmentary abtraction. Geometry will tell us of a circle, a thing never seen
in nature; asked about a green circle or an iron circle, it lays its hand
upon its mouth. So with the arts. Painting, ruefully comparing sunshine
and flake-white, gives up truth of colour, as it had already given up
relief and movement; and instead of vying with nature, arranges a scheme of
harmonious tints. Literature, above all in its most typical mood, the mood
of narrative, similarly flees the direct challenge and pursues instead an
independent and creative aim .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A proposition of geometry does
not compete with life; and a proposition of geometry is a fair and luminous
parallel for a work of art. Both are reasonable, both untrue to the crude
fact; both inhere in nature, neither represents it.

It is obvious that mathematics needs both sorts of mathematicians
[theory-builders and problem-solvers] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is equally obvious
that different branches of mathematics require different
aptitudes. In some, such as algebraic number theory, or the
cluster of subjects now known simply as Geometry, it seems .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
to be important for many reasons to build up a considerable
expertise and knowledge of the work that other mathematicians
are doing, as progress is often the result of clever
combinations of a wide range of existing results. Moreover, if
one selects a problem, works on it in isolation for a few years 
and finally solves it, there is a danger, unless the problem is 
very famous, that it will no longer be regarded as all that
significant.

At the other end of the spectrum is, for example, graph theory,
where the basic object, a graph, can be immediately comprehended.
One will not get anywhere in graph theory by sitting in an
armchair and trying to understand graphs better. Neither is it
particularly necessary to read much of the literature before 
tackling a problem: it is of course helpful to be aware of
some of the most important techniques, but the interesting 
problems tend to be open precisely because the established 
techniques cannot easily be applied.

Of the properties of mathematics, as a language, the most 
peculiar one is that by playing formal games with an input 
mathematical text, one can get an output text which seemingly 
carries new knowledge. The basic examples are furnished by 
scientific or technological calculations: general laws plus
initial conditions produce predictions, often only after 
time-consuming and computer-aided work. One can say that
the input contains an implicit knowledge which is thereby 
made explicit. One could try to find a parallel in the 
humanities by comparing this to hermeneutics: the art of 
finding hidden meanings of sacred texts. Legal discourse, 
too, has some common traits with scientific discourse. In 
the course of history, the modern language of science slowly 
emerged from these two archaic activities, and it still owes
a lot to them, especially in the more descriptive and less 
mathematicised domains.

First, I want to quote a definition of what is mathematics 
due to Davis and Hersh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "The study of mental objects 
with reproducible properties is called mathematics." I love 
this definition because it doesn't try to limit mathematics 
to what has been called mathematics in the past but really
attempts to say why certain communications are classified 
as math, others as science, others as art, others as gossip. 
Thus reproducible properties of the physical world are 
science whereas reproducible mental objects are math. Art
lives on the mental plane (the real painting is not the set 
of dry pigments on the canvas nor is a symphony the sequence 
of sound waves that convey it to our ear) but, as the 
post-modernists insist, is reinterpreted in new contexts
by each appreciator. As for gossip, which includes the vast 
majority of our thoughts, its essence is its relation to a 
unique local part of time and space.

Tl&ouml;n's geometry is made up of two rather distinct disciplines &mdash;

is subordinate to the visual. Visual geometry is based on the surface, not
the point; it has no parallel lines, and it claims that as one's body moves
through space, it modifies the shapes that surround it. The basis of
Tl&ouml;n's arithmetic is the notion of indefinite numbers; it stresses the
importance of the concepts "greater than" and "less than", which our own
mathematicians represent with the symbols &gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;. The people of
Tl&ouml;n are taught that the act of counting modifies the amount counted,
turning indefinites into definites. The fact that several persons counting
the same quantity come to the same result is for the psychologists of
Tl&ouml;n an example of the association of ideas or of memorization.

No mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more
than any other art or science, is a young man's game .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not
know an instance of a major mathematical advance initiated by a man past
fifty.

Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw
much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create;
and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but
in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to
bother about him.

In the applied mathematical textbooks current during my undergraduate days,
the formal arguments were mostly tolerably sound (though often very
irrelevant to current scientific progress). But their scientific philosophy
was very often quite unsound and superficial, as witness the statement in
one of them: "It is inconceivable that the original laws on which Mechanics
is based could be erroneous."

. . . we should not be disappointed that everyday language does not work any
longer at the apex of our little theory. It is natural; like poetry, the
very reason for the existence of mathematics is that it expresses thoughts
and feelings which we cannot express in mundane everyday language.

Did chemistry theorems exist? No: therefore you had to go further, not be
satisfied with the <i>quia</i>, go back to the origins, to mathematics and
physics. The origins of chemistry were ignoble, or at least equivocal:
the dens of the alchemists, their abominable hodgepodge of ideas and
language, their confessed interest in gold, their Levantine swindles
typical of charlatans and magicians; instead, at the origin of physics lay
the strenuous clarity of the West&mdash;Archimedes and Euclid.

As a Marxist mathematician, Kol'man insisted that human knowledge finds its
origin in the material world, not in the minds of scientists.
Marx and Engels had written that mathematics arose in the ancient world when
humans found it necessary to quantify material things like olive oil and
grain, and to measure land in primitive surveying operations. Thus, for
Marxists, mathematics was a science of material relationships. According to
Kol'man, while some areas of mathematics may have become very abstract in
modern times, the discipline never lost its contact with the exterior world.
He maintained that mathematics must be interpreted from the standpoint of
philosophical materialism.
</p>

<p>
Opposed to this view, said Kol'man, was the "idealistic, religious" view that
mathematics is merely created by human beings &mdash; that it is a product of
their minds, without a necessary relationship to the material world. In a 1931
article Kol'man even used technical arguments about Luzin's treatment of the
continuum, saying that Luzin "eliminates all points with rational coordinates,
which has even less to do with reality than absolute continuity". Kol'man
reproached Luzin for his "inability to understand the unity of continuous
and discrete". In his denunciation Kol'man accused Luzin of saying that
numbers "exist as a function of the mind of the mathematician". Here Kol'man
was using the debate of twenty years earlier and Luzin's anti-intuitionist
inclinations to accuse the latter  of absolute idealism &mdash; the belief
that a person gives a thing existence by thinking about it.

In my own professional work I have touched on a variety of different fields.
I've done work in mathematical linguistics, for example, without any
professional credentials in mathematics; in this subject I am completely
self-taught, and not very well taught. But I've often been invited by
universities to speak on mathematical linguistics at mathematics seminars
and colloquia. No one has ever asked me whether I have the appropriate
credentials to speak on these subjects; the mathematicians couldn't care less.
What they want to know is what I have to say. No one has ever objected to my
right to speak, asking whether I have a doctor's degree in mathematics, or
whether I have taken advanced courses in this subject. That would never have
entered their minds. They want to know whether I am right or wrong, whether
the subject is interesting or not, whether better approaches are possible 
&mdash; the discussion dealt with the subject, not with my right to discuss it.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand, in discussion and debate concerning social issues or
American foreign policy, Vietnam or the Middle East, for example, the issue
is constantly raised, often with considerable venom. I've repeatedly been
challenged on grounds of credentials, or asked, what special training do you
have that entitles you to speak of these matters. The assumption is that
people like me, who are outsiders from a professional viewpoint, are not
entitled to speak on such things.
</p>

<p>
Compare mathematics and the political sciences &mdash; it's quite striking. In 
mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with
your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must
have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted
framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the
richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern
for credentials, and the greater is the concern for content.

One evening I was in a group of people interested in psychology and religion,
where a friend of mine gave a talk on the means of perceiving the qualitative
reality of life. She helped illumine the meaning of life for her. I thought
her talk excellent, but no sooner had she stopped speaking than she was
pecked at from all sides:
</p>

<p>
"How can you say that poetic experience is 'real'? It cannot even be
demonstrated mathematically, and what is expressible mathematically is the
only true reality."
</p>

<p>
"How can you possibly say that you were 'at one' with Nature when you had
no proof that Nature was 'at one' with you? It probably felt quite the
contrary!"
</p>

<p>
I was upset because it appeared so obvious to me that what my friend was
talking about was not measurable at all by quantitative criteria. She used
words which usually express space and time and solid substance, like 
<i>inner</i> and <i>outer</i> and <i>higher</i> and <i>lower</i> and
<i>real</i> and <i>unreal</i>, because there were no other words for
expressing what she meant. But she used them symbolically and qualitatively,
not with their usual quantitative and spatial connotations; and because of
this, her meaning was not apparent to her listeners. They were really quite
nasty to her, and when I tried to come to her defence, I was pecked at too.
When I said that they had not understood the qualitative reality which my
friend had been talking about, they quite justifiably pointed out that I,
not understanding mathematics, was ignorant of what they knew was reality.

The frequent allusions to the Poets, and the various quotations interspersed
throughout the work, were intended as an agreeable relief to minds accustomed
to the regular deduction of facts, by mathematical reasoning ... Poetical
descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid
principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a
stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple
unadorned language.

I am very glad there are quite a number of people born with a gift and a
liking for all of this; like great chessplayers who play sixteen games at

Mathematicians, however, are well rewarded. I promise never to blackleg
their profession nor take the bread out of their mouths.
