.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the membership relation for sets can often be replaced by the
composition operation for functions. This leads to an alternative 
foundation for Mathematics upon categories &mdash; specifically, on 
the category of all functions. Now much of Mathematics is dynamic, 
in that it deals with morphisms of an object into another object 
of the same kind. Such morphisms (like functions) form categories, 
and so the approach via categories fits well with the objective 
of organizing and understanding Mathematics. That, in truth, 
should be the goal of a proper philosophy of Mathematics.

Nowadays, one of the most interesting points in mathematics is that, although 
all categorical reasonings are formally contradictory, we use them and we 
never make a mistake. Grothendieck provided a partial foundation in terms of 
universes but a revolution of the foundations similar to what Cauchy and 
Weierstrass did for analysis is still to arrive. In this respect, he was 
pragmatic: categories are useful and they give results so we do not have to 
look at subtle set-theoretic questions if there is no need. Is today the 
moment to think about these problems? Maybe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Category theory is intended as a universal language of mathematics, so all
concepts should be translated into it. Much as beavers, who as a species hate
the sound of running water, plaster a creek with mud and sticks until alas
that cursed tinkle stops, so do category theorists devise elaborate and 
obscure definitions in an attempt to capture a concept that to most of us
seemed perfectly clear before they got to it. But at least sometimes this
works admirably &ndash; for instance no one can be immune to the charm of
treating knot invariants with braided monoidal categories.

This generality of course comes with a price: it can wash away all of the
endearing special features of a favourite theory or structure. There certainly
are contexts where, for example, all human beings should be considered equal,
but there are other contexts where the given human is none other than your
mother and must be treated as such.
