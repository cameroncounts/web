<h1><i>Sets, Logic and Categories</i>: Misprints and further comments</h1>

<p>
Many thanks to those who have contributed to this list.

<ul>
<li> Page 4, Proof of Theorem 1.1: Yair Aviv suggests that the argument
here could be made clearer by writing it as follows:
<pre>
For every set y,     y is in S   iff   y is not in y.
In particular, when y is S,
                     S is in S   iff   S is not in S.
</pre> </li>
<li> Page 7, Section 1.3, third line: should read
<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>=<i>y</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>=<i>y</i><sub>2</sub>. (Spotted by Christopher Deeks.) </li>
<li> Page 12, line 13: for all <em>distinct</em> <i>p,q</i>... (Spotted
by Sheila Williams.) </li>
<li> Page 18, line 15: of <i>x</i>; that is, lower-case <i>x</i>.
(Spotted by Christopher Deeks.) </li>
<li> Page 18, Proof of Lemma 1.1: the case <i>Z</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&empty; has
to be considered separately. (Spotted by Katrin Tent.) </li>
<li> Page 19, line -9: <i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>g</i>(<i>y</i>). (Spotted by
Katrin Tent.) </li>
<li> Page 27, line 19: better "and so <i>Q</i> is at most countable. But
<i>Q</i> is infinite, so it is countable." (Spotted by Subhashis Mohanty.) </li>
<li> Page 28, Section 1.8: Kronecker really said "God made the integers ..."
(though he probably meant the positive integers). (Spotted
by Sheila Williams.)  I am in good company here: Peter H&oslash;eg, in
<i>Stories of the Night</i>, page 2, makes the same mistake. </li>
<li> In the same vein but less pompously, E. Borel said,
"All of mathematics can be deduced from the sole notion of an integer;
here we have a fact universally acknowledged today." </li>
<li> Pages 29-30, definition of the rational numbers is confused. Sheila
Williams says, "You've changed horses in midstream in your definition of the
rational numbers.  I think the easiest solution is to interchange <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, in Page 29 line &minus;6, and change
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i> in line &minus;4 of the same page." </li>
<li> Page 33, Exercise 1.5(a): the second formula should be
&mu;(&mu;(<i>x</i>,<i>g</i><sup>&minus;1</sup>)<i>g</i>) (that is, the last
symbol before the closing bracket is <i>g</i>, not <i>x</i>). </li>
<li> Page 34, Exercise 1.9: "injective" and "surjective" should <em>not</em> be
reversed, despite what was said here before. Also, the two functions in
part (b) should be <i>g</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>g</i><sub>2</sub>, not
<i>h</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>h</i><sub>2</sub>. (Thanks to Subhashis Mohanty
for clearing up the confusion.) </li>
<li> Page 35, line -3: delete "zemph". (Spotted by Sheila Williams.) </li>
<li> Page 42, Lemma 2.6, should read "&hellip; then <i>Y</i> is a section of 
<i>X</i>" (Spotted by Matthew Lewis.)
<li> Page 53, Exercise 2.6(b): should read &gamma;.(&alpha;+&beta;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&gamma;.&alpha;+&gamma;.&beta;. See <a href="ch2s.pdf">the solutions</a>
(PDF file). </li>
<li> Page 54, Exercise 2.12: Should be Exercise 1.17, not 1.16. </li>
<li> Page 61, line 2: <i>x</i>(&sigma;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;T should read
<i>v</i>(&sigma;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;T.  (Spotted by Kirk Sturtz.) </li>
<li> Page 85, bulleted list: the formulae equivalent to &phi;&and;&psi;
and &phi;&or;&psi; should be swapped. (Spotted by Matthew Lewis.) </li>
<li> Page 86, line 3: first word should be "those" rather than "thoe".
(Spotted by Matthew Lewis.) </li>
<li> Page 91, 2nd line of Step 2: for "Compactness" read "Completeness".
(Spotted by Chiaka.) </li>
<li> Page 103: Katrin Tent points out that the statement here that Peano
arithmetic has models appears to conflict with the qualification "If Peano
arithmetic is consistent" in Theorems 5.8 and 5.9. <i>Exercise</i>: what
is going on here? </li>
<li> Page 106, line 11: (A5) should be (A4). (Pointed out by Chuks Kamalu). </li>
<li>  Page 116, line 17 should read "&hellip; and so
<i>x</i><sub><i>n</i>+1</sub> in <i>y</i>&cap;<i>x</i>, contradicting
Foundation". (Spotted by Matthew Lewis.) </li>
<li> Page 116, line 20: "for all <i>n</i>" (not <i>x</i>).
(Spotted by Matthew Lewis.) </li>
<li> Page 119, proof that AC implies ZL: there is no need to assume that
the partially ordered set is non-empty. The empty poset contains the
empty chain which has no upper bound! (Spotted by Katrin Tent.)
<li> At the end of this proof: of course, it is not the <i>set</i> but
the <i>class</i> of all ordinals &ndash; this is the point of the contradiction.
(Spotted by Katrin Tent.) </li>
<li> Page 120, line 3: <i>f</i><sub>0</sub> is a bijection.
(Spotted by Katrin Tent.) </li>
<li> Page 127, line 16: If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are both finite, it is
not true that
 |<i>x</i>|+|<i>y</i>|=max(|<i>x</i>|,|<i>y</i>|),</br>
but it is still true that <i>x</i>+<i>y</i> is less than &alpha;,
since &alpha; is infinite. (Spotted by Katrin Tent.) </li>
<li> Page 127 line -11:  the section <i>P</i><sub>(<i>u,v</i>)</sub> (Spotted by
Sheila Willliams). Also, Chow Ka Fat points out that line &minus;7 should say
|<i>s</i>(&beta;)&times;<i>s</i>(&beta;)|&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&alpha;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;|<i>s</i>(&beta;)|. </li>
<li> Page 129, last line: assuming ZFC is consistent.
(Spotted by Katrin Tent.) </li>
