Dear Peter,

        Indeed, I'd appreciate comments on the manuscript. I'll send it
early next week, modulo the discovery of no errors; it's only one page long.

        I already have; moreover I brought it to Columbia University for
printing, and then to a local print shop for a spiral binding. Here are some
non-technical reactions to your bound (but unbounded) manuscript:

        In Figure 3.3, the cube on the right, which you use as an aid to
explain the concept of antipodal equivalence classes, is labeled clockwise
in bridge-suit order: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. Therefore,
although the cube can't be duplicated, it *can* be doubled...

        Finally, a happenstance glance at bibliographic reference [51]
inspired?? me to compose some extremely brief mathematical doggerel which
purports to comment on the changing mathematical landscape. It applies to
both sexes, each for a different reason:
