Hi,
    sorry to bother you for such a minor and harmless misprint.

Exercise 7.4, section 7.5, page 198.

  Use Burnside's Theorem and table 6.4 to determine the transitive ...

should probably be

  Use Burnside's Theorem and table 7.4 to determine the transitive ...

I guess it is just enough to latex the document one more time.
Sorry again but the temptation to write to Peter J. Cameron was eventually
too strong... 

regards,
                                Alberto.                  *

Dear Peter,

> If you send me the rest of your name I can acknowledge you properly.

  I feel so honoured and happy just by receiving your message. Really it
would be much too much for me to appear anywhere because of that little
tiny misprint. In fact, I would rather wait for a more important reason,
in the hope that there will be one (which does not need to be a worse
misprint on "Permutation Groups" of course).

However, my name is Alberto Basile, born in Verona, Italy in 1968 and
graduated in matematica at the university of Padova in 1996 under the
supervision of Prof F. Menegazzo and A. Lucchini with a thesis concernig
finite permutation groups. I was at Castelvecchio Pascoli in July 1996
where I've seen you for the first time. I did not give any talk though. I
am now enrolled as research PhD student here at the ANU under the
supervision of L. G. Kovacs. I should finish by the end of the Year.

I have not published anything yet, nor I have produced something worth's
reading. I'm trying to prove that there are only finitely many lattices of
heights $2$ which are intervals in the subgroup lattice of an alternating
(or symmetric) group with the alternating (or symmetric) group as top
group of the interval. That is, there are only finitely many positive
integers $n$ such that there is a subgroup $H$ of an alternating finite
(or symmetric) group, say $G$, such that the proper subgroups of $G$
properly containing $H$ are exactly in number of $n$ and also al these
subgroups are maximal in $G$. This is a little subcase of an open question
coming from universal algebra. It is proved that every finite lattice is
interval in the subgroup lattice of some group but no-one could make that
group to be finite as well. In fact, it is a general feeling that it is
not possible. Not even for the very elementary lattices of length $2$.

Anyway, thank you again for your reply. I will probably meet you before
the end of the Year here in Australia.

See you then,
                           
                                Alberto.                  *
