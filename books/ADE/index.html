diagrams and their many occurrences in mathematics.

<h3>More ADE stories</h3>
<p>
If and when I learn about new ADE stories, I will put a note here.
There is no guarantee that they do not extend to, for example, all
Coxeter&ndash;Dynkin diagrams, or even that such an extension is not
already in the literature.
</p>
<h3>BMW algebras</h3>
<p>
I found this in the thesis of Di&eacute; Gijsbers at the University of
Eindhoven, written under the supervision of Arjeh Cohen and David Wales. 
Here is some background, which lies in the subject area of knots and links.
</p>
<p>
The <em>braid group</em> on <i>n</i> strings is generated by <i>n</i>&minus;1
elements <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <i>s</i><sub><i>n</i>&minus;1</sub>
satisfying the following relations:
<ul>
<li> the <em>braid relations</em>:
<i>s<sub>i</sub>s</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub><i>s<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>s</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub><i>s<sub>i</sub>s</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>; </li>
<li> if |<i>i&minus;j</i>|&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1 then <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> and <I>s<sub>j</sub></i> commute. </li>
</ul>
It has the symmetric group S<sub><i>n</i></sub> as a quotient obtained by
adding the relations <i>s<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>
The question whether the braid group is a linear group was open for some
time, but was resolved in the affirmative by Bigelow and Krammer
(independently).
</p>
<p>
The </em>Hecke algebra</em> is a deformation of the braid group. There is a
trace function on the Hecke algebra which gives rise to the so-called
<em>HOMFLY polynomial</em>, a famous knot invariant. (The acronym is the
initial letters of its discoverers, Hoste, Oceanu, Millet, Freyd, Lickorish
and Yetter.)
</p>
<p>
All this can be generalised to the ADE diagrams (and parts even to all the
spherical Coxeter&ndash;Dynkin diagrams, but I will stick to ADE). The
<em>Artin group</em> generalises the braid group by taking a generator for 
each vertex of the diagram, and imposing the braid relation if the two
vertices are adjacent and the commuting relation otherwise. The definition
of the Hecke algebra also generalises. Cohen and Wales showed that all the
Artin groups of type ADE are linear.
</p>
<p>
The <em>BMW algebra</em>, named for its discoverers Birman and Wenzel and
independently Murakami, is a further deformation of the braid group. This
was extended to the other ADE types by Cohen, Gijsbers and Wales.
</p>
Gijsbers' thesis discusses all this in far more detail, including the
connection with knots and links, the Brauer algebra, and details of the
linear representations.

<h3>E<sub></sub>7.5</sub></h3>
  <p>
    At a workshop on Algebra, Combinatorics, Dynamics and Applications in Belfast in 2013,
    I learned some numerology in a talk by Dmitriy Rumynin. There is much more to it than
    numerology, as the talk showed; but I will stick to that.
</p>
<p>
Pierre Deligne proposed that the Lie algebras E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub> and E<sub>8</sub>
  and the other exceptional Lie algebras are not sporadic but actually part of a family.
  Indeed, he gave a formula, namely
</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">
&minus;2(&lambda;+5)(&lambda;&minus;6)/&lambda;(&lambda;&minus;1),
</p>
<p>
which for various negative rational values of &lambda; evaluates to the dimensions of all 
  the exceptional Lie algebras and a few small classical ones too for good measure
  (A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>). In particular, for
  &lambda;=&minus;1/2,&nbsp;&minus;1/3,&nbsp;&minus;1/5, its values are
  78,&nbsp;133,&nbsp;248, the dimensions of E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, and E<sub>8</sub>.
</p>
<p>
Now someone pointed out that there is an obvious gap here, namely &lambda;=&minus;1/4, for
  which the formula evaluates to 190. The mythical Lie algebra of dimension 190 has been
  named E<sub>7.5</sub>. Dmitriy didn't want to talk about this, but when someone asked him
  "Does it exist?" he replied, "It is more real than I am: it has a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E7.5">Wikipedia page</a>, I don't."
</p>
<p>
Indeed, there is a Lie algebra of dimension 190; it is not simple, but is related to E<sub>7</sub>.
  It is an extension of a Heisenberg algebra associated with E<sub>7</sub> with the algebra
  E<sub>7</sub> itself, and the numerology is
</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">
133+1+56&nbsp;=&nbsp;190.
