<h4>Recognising the commuting graph</h4>
<p>
There are many graphs defined on groups which have been studied recently, including the power graph, generating graph, and
 independence graph. The questions posed here for the commuting graph could be repeated for any of the others.
</p>
<p>
The commuting graph of <i>G</i> has vertex set <i>G</i>, with two vertices adjacent if and only if they commute. Given a graph,
how hard is it to decide if it is the commuting graph of some group (and to construct the group if the answer is yes)?
</p>
<p>
This is a slightly strange question since a finite group can be defined with polylogarithmically many bits but a graph takes
 polynomially many bits to describe.
</p>
<p>
In a recent paper with V. Arvind, X. Ma and N. Maslova, which can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2025.07.020">here</a>,
 we showed that there is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for this.
 The proof involved finding a short description of a finite group which could be translated quickly into the multiplication table and <em>vice versa</em>.
</p>
<p>
We also conjectured that, for certain nice classes of graphs such as cographs and chordal graphs, the computation might be possible in polynomial time.

<h3>A problem</h3>
<p>
Consider the following three graphs defined on a finite group <i>G</i>:
<ul>
<li> The <em>power graph</em>: <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are joined if one is a power of the other. </li>
<li> The <em>enhanced power graph</em>: <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are joined if they
are each powers of some element <i>w</i>. </li>
<li> The <em>intersection power graph</em>: <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are joined if
some non-identity element <i>z</i> is a power of each of them (and, by
convention, the identity is joined to all other elements). </li>
</ul>
The power graph is a (spanning) subgraph of each of the others. When can we have
equality?
</p>
<p>
It is known that the power graph and enhanced power graph are equal if and only
if every element of <i>G</i> has prime power order. After preliminary work by Higman and Suzuki, such groups were all determined by Brandl.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> For which groups are the power graph and the intersection power
graph equal? 
</p>
<p>
It is known that groups in which all elements have prime order have this 
property, and that it implies that the power graph is a cograph. But an exact
characterisation is unknown.
</p>
<p>
What we know about this question is in my paper with Sudip Bera, arXiv
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03919">2509.03919</a>.
