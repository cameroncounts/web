<a name="P1"><B>Problem 1.</B></a>
Is there a function <I>F</I>(<I>m,p</I>) (where the first argument is an
integer and the second a prime) such that, if <I>G</I> is a finite
permutation group which is a <I>p</I>-group with <I>m</I> orbits,
each of size at least <I>p</I><SUP><I>F</I>(<I>m,p</I>)</SUP>, then
<I>G</I> contains a fixed-point-free element? (This is a very old problem;
for <I>p</I>=2, it is implicitly due to Isbell in 1959.)

<p>
<strong>STOP PRESS</strong> 23 December 2008: 
Eleonora Crestani and Pablo Spiga have claimed
a negative solution to this problem. More news later .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<HR>

<a name="P2"><B>Problem 2.</B></a>
Let <I>G</I> be a permutation group on an infinite set 
<I>X</I>. There is a
graded algebra <I>A</I>[<I>G</I>] associated with <I>G</I> as follows:
the <I>n</I>th
homogeneous component <I>V<SUB>n</SUB></I> is the set of all
<I>G</I>-invariant functions from
the set of <I>n</I>-element subsets of <I>X</I> to the complex numbers;
multiplication is defined by the rule that, if 
<I>f in V<SUB>n</SUB></I>, <I>g in V<SUB>m</SUB></I>,
and <I>K</I> is an (<I>n</I>+<I>m</I>)-element set then
<P>
(<I>fg</I>)(<I>K</I>) = <I>sum</I> <I>f</I>(<I>L</I>)<I>g</I>(<I>K-L</I>)
: <I>L subseteq K</I>, |<I>L</I>| = <I>n</I>.
<P>
The constant function <I>e in V</I><SUB>1</SUB> with value 1 is not a 
zero-divisor. We say that <I>G</I> is <B>entire</B> if <I>A</I>[<I>G</I>]
is an integral domain, and
<B>strongly entire</B> if <I>A</I>[<I>G</I>]/<I>eA</I>[<I>G</I>] is an
integral domain. It is
conjectured that <I>G</I> is (strongly) entire if and only if it has no
finite orbits on <I>X</I>. In the absence of a proof of this conjecture,
can one show the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the permutation groups <I>G</I><SUB>1</SUB> on <I>X</I><SUB>1</SUB> and
<I>G</I><SUB>2</SUB> on <I>X</I><SUB>2</SUB>
are (strongly) entire, then <I>G</I><SUB>1</SUB> &times; <I>G</I><SUB>2</SUB> 
(in its intransitive action on <I>X</I><SUB>1</SUB> <I>union X</I><SUB>2</SUB>)
is (strongly) entire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<b>Note</b>: Maurice Pouzet has proved that, if <I>G</I> has
no finite orbits, then <I>G</I> is entire. This appears in
<i>Theor. Inform. Appl.</i> <b>42</b> (2008), 83-103.

<HR>

<a name="P3"><B>Problem 3.</B></a>
Let <I>S</I> be the symmetric group on the infinite set <I>X</I>.
Consider the product action of <I>S</I><SUP>2</SUP> on <I>X</I><SUP>2</SUP>, 
and let <I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I> be the number of orbits on subsets of 
size <I>n</I>.
The problem is to find a formula for, or an efficient means of
calculating, <I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I>.

<P>

The number <I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I> has various other interpretations:
<UL>
<LI> It is the number of zero-one matrices with <I>n</I> ones,
with no zero rows or columns, up to row and column permutation.
<LI> It is the number of bipartite graphs with <I>n</I> edges,
no isolated vertices, and a distinguished bipartite block, up to
isomorphism.
</UL>

<P>

The initial terms in the sequence can be found

<HR>

<a name="P4"><B>Problem 4.</B></a> This problem is due to Dragan Marusic
and Mikhail Klin. It appears in the
<A HREF="prob15.tex">research problems</A> from the 15th
British Combinatorial Conference.

A permutation group <I>G</I> is <B>2-closed</B> if
any permutation which preserves the orbits of <I>G</I> on
ordered pairs belongs to <I>G</I>.
<B>Problem:</B> is there a 2-closed transitive 
permutation group containing no non-identity semiregular subgroup?

<P>

(Not every transitive permutation group contains a
non-identity semiregular subgroup; the smallest counterexample has
degree 12.)

<P>

<B>Note:</B> Michael Giudici has some partial results on this problem,
including the statement that every minimal normal subgroup of any
counterexample to the conjecture is intransitive. See:

<HR>

<a name="P5"><B>Problem 5.</B></a>
A <B>base</B> for a permutation group <I>G</I>
is a sequence of points whose pointwise stabiliser
is the identity; it is <B>irredundant</B> if no point in the sequence is
fixed by the stabiliser of its predecessors. The group <I>G</I> is said to
be an <B>IBIS group</B> if any two irredundant bases have the same number
of elements. If this condition holds, then the irredundant bases are the
bases of a matroid (and conversely). It is too much to ask for a
classification of IBIS groups (since, for example, any semiregular
group is IBIS); but can one classify the matroids which can arise?

<P>

Note added 22 November 2001: The matroids include all those representable
over finite fields (with each element replaced by <I>q</I> parallel elements,
where <I>q</I> is the field order). See Problem 18 below for further details.

<HR>


<a name="P6"><B>Problem 6.</B></a> McIver and Neumann, <I>Quart. J. Math.</I> 
(2) <B>38</B> (1987), 473-488, showed that a subgroup of the symmetric
group <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> can be generated by at most <I>n/2</I> elements,
provided that <I>n</I> is at least 4. <B>Problem:</B> Give an efficient
algorithm to find such a generating set, preferably an "on-line" algorithm
(one which, given a small generating set for <I>H</I> and a permutation
<I>g</I>, finds efficiently a small generating set for the group generated
by <I>H</I> and <I>g</I>).

<HR>

<a name="P7"><B>Problem 7.</B></a> 
Martin Liebeck and Aner Shalev have shown that there is
an absolute constant <I>c</I> such that an almost simple primitive finite
permutation group, which is not a symmetric or alternating group acting
on subsets or partitions, or a classical group acting on subspaces or
complementary pairs of subspaces in its natural module, has a base of
size <I>c</I>. Does this assertion hold with <I>c</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 
(if we allow finitely many more exceptions)?

<P>

<b>Note added 13/7/2007</b>: It has now been proved by Burness <i>et al.</i>
that the assertion holds for <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;6, with a single
exception, the Mathieu group <i>M</i><sub>24</sub>.

<HR>

<a name="P8"><B>Problem 8.</B></a>
Let <I>G</I> be a transitive permutation group on a set <I>X</I>.
For each orbit <I>O<SUB>i</SUB></I> of <I>G</I> on <I>X</I><SUP>2</SUP>,
we associate a <EM>basis matrix</EM> <I>A<SUB>i</SUB></I>, whose 
<I>xy</I> entry is equal to 1 if (<I>x,y</I>) is in <I>O<SUB>i</SUB></I>,
or 0 otherwise. The matrices <I>A<SUB>i</SUB></I> span an algebra, which
is the <EM>centraliser algebra</EM> of the permutation group <I>G</I>.

<P>

A subalgebra of the centraliser algebra which contains the identity matrix
and is spanned by symmetric
zero-one matrices is the <EM>Bose-Mesner algebra</EM> of an
<EM>association scheme</EM> on the set <I>X</I>, and <I>G</I> acts
as a group of automorphisms of this association scheme. There is always
at least one such subalgebra, namely the span of <I>I</I> and 
<I>J-I</I>, where <I>J</I> is the all-one matrix. We call this subalgebra
or association scheme <EM>trivial</EM>.

<P>

<B>Problem:</B> For which transitive permutation groups is it true that
the only association scheme invariant under <I>G</I> is the trivial one?

<P>

This class of groups includes the 2-homogeneous groups. Any such group
must be primitive, and (if not 2-homogeneous) is either of diagonal type
or almost simple. 

<P>

Examples which are not 2-homogeneous do exist. Some can be found in table
3.5.1 of I. A. Faradzev, M. H. Klin and M. E. Muzichuk, "Cellular rings and
groups of automorphisms of graphs", pp. 1-152 in <I>Investigations in
Algebraic Theory of Combinatorial Objects</I> (ed. I. A. Faradzev, A. A.
Ivanov, M. H. Klin and A. J. Woldar), Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1994. The smallest is
the group PSL(3,3) acting on the cosets of PO(3,3); this group has
degree 234. (I am grateful to Leonard Soicher for this reference).

<P>

No such group of diagonal type is known, and the problem of deciding whether
any such group exists remains open. There are none having two or three
simple factors in their socle. See:

<a name="P9"><B>Problem 9.</B></a> A derangement problem.

<P>

Let <I>d(k,n)</I> be the proportion of derangements in
the symmetric group <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> in its action on <I>k</I>-sets.
Then <I>d(k,n)</I> tends to a limit <I>a(k)</I> as <I>n</I> tends to
infinity. (So, for example, <I>a</I>(1)=e<SUP>-1</SUP> - this is the usual
"derangement problem".) Does <I>a(k)</I> tend monotonically to 1 as <I>k</I>
tends to infinity?

<HR>

<a name="P10"><B>Problem 10.</B></a> 
It is known that, for any finite group <I>G</I>, if
<I>x(G,n)</I> is the number of (unlabelled) graphs on <I>n</I> vertices
whose automorphism group contains <I>G</I>, and <I>y(G,n)</I> the number
whose automorphism group is precisely <I>G</I>, then the ratio
<I>y(G,n)/x(G,n)</I> tends to a limit as <I>n</I> tends to infinity.

<P>

<B>Problem:</B> Does this result hold for trivalent graphs? What about
other special classes of graphs such as strongly regular graphs? 

<HR>

<a name="P11"><B>Problem 11.</B></a>

The <I>Parker vector</I> of a finite permutation group <I>G</I> is the
<I>n</I>-tuple whose <I>k</I>th component is the number of orbits of <I>G</I>
on the set of <I>k</I>-cycles occurring in elements of <I>G</I>.

<P>

If <I>G</I> has the same Parker vector as a Frobenius group
(resp. a 2-transitive group), is it a Frobenius group (resp.
a 2-transitive group)?

<HR>

<a name="P12"><B>Problem 12.</B></a>

Is the following true?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

	If <I>P</I> is a 2-group which is not elementary abelian, then some
	non-identity element of the centre of <I>P</I> is a square.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The answer to this question is negative. The smallest counterexamples
have order 128, and there are two of them. This was found by Alexander
Hulpke and Andreas Caranti. Alexander provided the following example in GAP:

<PRE>

gap> g:=SmallGroup(128,36);
<pc group of size 128 with 7 generators>
gap> z:=Centre(g);
Group([ f6, f7 ])
gap> r:=List(ConjugacyClasses(g),Representative);;
gap> s:=Filtered(r,i->Order(i)>2);;
gap> List(s,Order);
[ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ]
gap> Set(List(s,i->i^2));
[ f4,f5,f4*f7,f5*f6,f3*f4*f5,f3*f4*f5*f6,f3*f4*f5*f7,f3*f4*f5*f6*f7 ]
gap> List(last,i->i in z);
[ false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false ]

</PRE>

If not, is the following weaker statement true?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

	If <I>P</I> is a 2-group which is not elementary abelian, and
	<I>Q</I> is a core-free subgroup of <I>P</I>, then there is an
	element lying in no conjugate of <I>Q</I> which is a square.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Avinoam Mann also suggested the above group as a possible counterexample to the
second question. However, Steve Linton and John Murray both checked that
there is no core-free subgroup Q for which it is a counterexample. So
the question is still open.

<P>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT> (13 September 2004):
The answer to the second question is also
negative. Pablo Spiga found that the group of order 128 with generators
(1,2,7,3)(4,8)(5,11)(6,9)(10,14)(12,16,13,15),
(1,4,7,5)(2,8)(3,11)(6,13,14,12)(9,15)(10,16), and
(1,6)(2,9,3,10)(4,12,5,13)(7,14)(8,15)(11,16)
is a counterexample. Indeed, in this group the set of elements with
fixed points coincides with the set of squares. This group is
<TT>SmallGroup(128,836)</TT> in the GAP library.

<P> 

The motivating question, whether a vertex-transitive trivalent graph
necessarily has a semiregular automorphism of order greater than 2, is
currently still open. (But see Problem 23.)

<HR>

<a name="P13"><B>Problem 13.</B></a>

It is known that, if <I>G</I> is a permutation group in which every
non-identity element fixes exactly <I>k</I> points, then either <I>G</I>
has a fixed set of size <I>k</I>, or <I>G</I> is one of a finite
list of groups (for given <I>k</I>). The problem is to find a good upper
bound (in terms of <I>k</I>) for the orders of the groups in this finite
list.

<P>

For example, when <I>k</I>=2, the groups are the tetrahedral, octahedral
and icosahedral groups, acting on the vertices, edges and faces of the
corresponding polyhedra. (Every rotation has an axis, so has just two
fixed points in this action.) So the correct bound is 60.
(This is a theorem of Iwahori, <I>J. Fac. Sci., Univ. Tokyo</I>
<B>11</B> (1964), 47-64.)

<P>

An upper bound in terms of <I>k</I> has been found by C. Franchi,
On permutation groups of finite type,
<I>European J. Combinatorics</I> <B>22</B> (2001), 821-837.

<HR>

<a name="P14"><B>Problem 14.</B></a>

Let <I>G</I> be a finite group, <I>a</I> an automorphism of <I>G</I>,
and <I>X</I> the semidirect product of <I>G</I> by the group generated
by <I>a</I>. Suppose that every element of <I>X</I> not in <I>G</I>
has prime order <I>p</I>.

<P>

It follows that the centraliser of <I>a</I> in <I>G</I> is a <I>p</I>-group.
Let its order be <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I>.

<P>

A theorem of Kegel (<I>Math. Z.</I> <B>75</B> (1961), 373-376) shows that
<I>G</I> is nilpotent. Then a theorem of Khukhro (<I>Mat. Zametki</I>
<B>38</B> (1985), 652-657) shows that <I>G</I> has a normal subgroup
whose nilpotency class and index are bounded by functions of <I>p</I>
and <I>m</I>.

<P>

Is it true that the nilpotency class of <I>G</I> is bounded by a function
of <I>p</I> and <I>m</I>?

<P>

This question has been settled in the affirmative by 
<A HREF=mailto:mtbjazaa@lg.ehu.es>Andrei Jaikin</A>, using a theorem
of E. Khukhro, On locally nilpotent groups admitting a
splitting automorphism of prime order, <I>Mat. sb.</I> <B>130</B> (1986),
120-127.

<HR>

<a name="P15"><B>Problem 15.</B></a>

Let <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> and <I>P<SUB>n</SUB></I> be the respectively
the symmetric group (the set of all permutations) and the set of all
partitions on the set [1..<I>n</I>]. There is a function
<I>F</I> from <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> to <I>P<SUB>n</SUB></I> which
replaces every permutation by the partition corresponding to its
cycle decomposition.

<P> 

(a) Is there an efficient method to decide whether a set of partitions
is the image under <I>F</I> of a <EM>subgroup</EM> of <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I>?

<P>

(b) If <I>G</I> and <I>H</I> are subgroups of <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> such
that <I>F</I>(<I>G</I>)=<I>F</I>(<I>H</I>), then <I>G</I> and <I>H</I>
have the same order. <EM>Are they necessarily isomorphic</EM>?

<P>

Note added 19 May 2000: The answer to (b) is negative. Eamonn O'Brien
has shown that there are two pairs of groups of order 64 (numbers
19 and 111, and 94 and 249, in the lists in MAGMA and GAP), which act
transivitely on 16 points, such that the two groups in each pair give
rise to the same sets of cycle partitions. You can find
<A HREF="permgps/cycles.txt">a GAP program</A> to verify this.

<a name="P16"><B>Problem 16.</B></a>

Let <I>G</I> be a subgroup of the symmetric group <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I>.
For <I>i</I> = 0, ..., <I>n</I>, let <I>p<SUB>i</SUB></I> be the
probability that a random element of <I>G</I> has exactly <I>i</I>
fixed points, and let <I>F<SUB>i</SUB></I> be the number of orbits
of <I>G</I> on <I>i</I>-tuples of distinct points. These two sequences
determine each other. In fact, 
N. Boston, W. Dabrowski, T. Foguel, P. J. Gies, J. Leavitt, D. T. Ose
and D. A. Jackson,
<I>Communications in Algebra</I> <B>21</B> (1993), 3259-3275, showed
that, if <BR>
<I>P</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>Sum p<SUB>i</SUB> x<SUP>i</SUP></I>
and <I>F</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>Sum F<SUB>i</SUB> x<SUP>i</SUP>/i</I>! , then
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>F</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>P</I>(<I>x</I>+1).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Now consider the linear analogue. Let <I>G</I> be a subgroup of the 
general linear group GL(<I>n,q</I>). For <I>i</I> = 0, ..., <I>n</I>, let
<I>p<SUB>i</SUB></I> be the probability that the fixed points of a random
element form precisely an <I>i</I>-dimensional subspace, and
let <I>F<SUB>i</SUB></I> be the number of orbits of <I>G</I> on
linearly independent <I>i</I>-tuples. Again the two sequences determine
each other.

<P>

<B>Problem:</B> Express the relation between these two sequences in terms

<a name="P18"><B>Problem 18.</B></a>

<P>

A <I>base</I> for a permutation group is a sequence of points whose stabiliser
is the identity; it is <I>irredundant</I> if no point is fixed by the
stabiliser of its predecessors. Cameron and Fon-Der-Flaass, <I>Europ. J.
Combinatorics</I> <B>16</B> (1995), 537-544, called a permutation group
an <I>IBIS group</I> if all irredundant bases have the same number of
elements; they showed that the irredundant bases of an IBIS group are the
bases of a matroid.

<P>

<B>Problem:</B> What is the relation between the Tutte polynomial of the
matroid and the cycle index of the permutation group?

<P> It is known that sometimes the first determines the second and sometimes

<a name="P19"><B>Problem 19.</B></a>

<P>

How large is the largest antichain of subgroups of the symmetric group
<I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I>? More precisely, estimate
<I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I>/<I>s<SUB>n</SUB></I>, where <I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I> is
the size of the largest antichain and <I>s<SUB>n</SUB></I> the total
number of subgroups.

<HR>

<a name="P20"><B>Problem 20.</B></a>

<P>

Let <I>L</I>(<I>G</I>) be the subgroup lattice of the finite group <I>G</I>.
Is the following true or false? Suppose that the Boolean lattice
<I>B</I>(<I>n</I>) of subsets of an <I>n</I>-element set is embeddable
as a meet-semilattice of <I>L</I>(<I>G</I>), and suppose that <I>n</I> is 
maximal with this property. Then there is an embedding of <I>B</I>(<I>n</I>)
as meet-semilattice, such that the least element of <I>B</I>(<I>n</I>) 
is a normal subgroup of <I>G</I>.

<P>

<I>Note:</I> The quaternion group <I>Q</I><SUB>8</SUB> shows that we
cannot make the least element of <I>B</I>(<I>n</I>) correspond to the
identity in general.

<HR>

<a name="P21"><B>Problem 21.</B></a>

<P>

Let <I>Z</I>(<I>G</I>) denote the cycle index of the permutation group
<I>G</I>, and let <I>F<SUB>n</SUB></I><SUP>*</SUP>(<I>G</I>) be the number of
orbits of <I>G</I> on the set of all <I>n</I>-tuples of its permutation
domain.

<P>

Let <I>G</I> and <I>H</I> be permutation groups acting on sets <I>X</I> and
<I>Y</I> respectively. We consider <I>G</I>&times;<I>H</I> as a permutation
group on <I>X</I>&times;<I>Y</I>. We have
<UL>
<LI> <I>Z</I>(<I>G</I>&times;<I>H</I>)  =
<I>Z</I>(<I>G</I>)o<I>Z</I>(<I>H</I>), where
<I>s<SUB>i</SUB></I>o<I>s<SUB>j</SUB></I> =
(<I>s</I><SUB>lcm(<I>i,j</I>)</SUB>)<SUP>gcd(<I>i,j</I>)</SUP>, and the
operation is extended multiplicatively and additively;
<LI> <I>F<SUB>n</SUB></I><SUP>*</SUP>(<I>G&times;H</I>) =
<I>F<SUB>n</SUB></I><SUP>*</SUP>(<I>G</I>)<I>F<SUB>n</SUB></I><SUP>*</SUP>(<I>
H</I>).
</UL>
The second assertion is trivially proved directly. The challenge is to deduce
it from the first; this will probably require methods of dealing with these
very strange operations on polynomials.

<P>

Let <i>G</i> be a Frobenius group with Frobenius kernel <i>N</I> and 
Frobenius complement <i>H</i> having orders <i>n</i> and <i>h</i>
respectively. Number the elements of <i>N</I> as 
<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>x<sub>n</sub></i>. Now let
<i>X<sub>ij</sub></i> be the <i>n</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>n</i> matrix
with (<i>k,l</i>) entry equal to the cardinality of the intersection of
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i><sup>-1</sup><i>Hx<sub>k</sub></i> and 
<i>x<sub>j</sub></i><sup>-1</sup><i>Hx<sub>l</sub></i>.
Note that <i>X<sub>ii</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;hI</i> while, for <i>i</i> and
<i>j</i> distinct, <i>X<sub>ij</sub></i> is a zero-one matrix.

<p>

Is it true that
<blockquote>
Sum<sub><i>k</i></sub>&nbsp;<i>X<sub>ik</sub>X<sub>kj</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;nX<sub>ij</sub>+h(h-1)J</i>,
</blockquote>
where <i>J</i> is the all-one matrix?

<a name="P23"><b>Problem 23.</b></a>
Since Problem 20 in the <A HREF="oldprob.html">list of old problems</A>
has a negative solution, the following problem (due to John Sheehan and me,
BCC problem 17.12) is open again.<P>

Is it true that a vertex-transitive trivalent graph has a semiregular
automorphism (one with all cycles of the same size) of order greater
than 2?<p>

<b>Note:</b> This has now been settled affirmatively: see

<i>Europ. J. Combinatorics</i> <b>27</b> (2006), 924-930; doi:

<a name="P24"><b>Problem 24.</b></a>
Let <i>G</i> be a permutation group of degree <i>n</i>. The <em>base size</em>
of <i>G</i> is the smallest number <i>b</i>(<i>G</i>) of points whose
stabiliser is the identity; the <em>separation number</em> of <i>G</i> is the
smallest size of a set <i>S</i> of points such that, for any two distinct
points <i>x,y</i>, there exists <i>s</i> in <i>S</i> such that <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> lie in distinct orbits of the stabiliser of <i>s</i>.

<p>

Clearly <i>b</i>(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>s</i>(<i>G</i>). Is it true
that, if <i>G</i> is primitive but not 2-transitive, then
<i>s</i>(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>b</i>(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>?

(<a href="csgnotes/basesep.pdf">PDF file</a>).

<a name="P25"><b>Problem 25.</b></a>
Let <b>F</b> be the set of sequences <i>F</i> of positive integers whose 
<i>n</i>th term is the number of orbits on <i>n</i>-tuples of distinct elements
of an infinite permutation group.

<p>

<i>Is <b>F</b> closed under pointwise multiplication?</i>

<p>

I conjecture that the answer is "no". Specifically, let <i>F</i> be the
sequence (1,2,4,10,26,...) whose <i>n</i>th term is the number of solutions of 
<i>g</i><sup>2</sup>=1 in the symmetric group of degree <i>n</i>. This
sequence belongs to <b>F</b>, but I conjecture that the sequence 
(1,4,16,100,676...)
whose terms are the squares of the terms in this sequence is not in <b>F</b>.

<p>

<b>Remark:</b> The set of sequences counting orbits of permutation groups on
all <i>n</i>-tuples is closed under pointwise multiplication. Moreover, the
set of sequences counting orbits on <i>n</i>-tuples of distinct elements for
groups with the property that the stabiliser of a finite set fixes no
additional points is closed under pointwise multiplication.

<P>

<b>Further remark:</b> The answer in general is "no": if <i>G</i> is the
stabiliser of a point in the symmetric group, the sequence begins 2, 3, 4, ...,
but a group with 4 orbits on points must have at least 12 orbits on ordered
pairs of distinct points. It is harder for transitive groups
(where a possible counterexample is given in the question), and still more so
for primitive groups.
<hr>

<a name="P26"><b>Problem 26.</b></a>
I conjectured in 1972 that there is a function <i>f</i> with the following
property: Let <i>G</i> be a finite primitive permutation group, with rank
<i>r</i>; let <i>s</i> be the <em>subrank</em> of <i>G</i>, the maximum rank
of a point stabiliser on any of its orbits. Then either
<ul>
<li> <i>G</i> has a base of size 2; or
<li> <i>r</i>&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>f</i>(<i>s</i>).
</ul>
Perhaps the time has come to revisit this conjecture.
<p>
The most extreme example I know is an extension of a 2<i>n</i>-dimensional
vector space over GF(2) by a dihedral group of order
2(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>+1); this has rank 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> and subrank
2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup>+1. So perhaps the conjecture holds with a linear
function <i>f</i>.
<hr>

<a name="P27"><b>Problem 27.</b></a>
Let <i>S</i> be a set of elements of the symmetric group <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>.
It is not always true that every element in the group generated by <i>S</i>
can be written as a word in <i>S</i> of length bounded by a polynomial in
<i>n</i>. (Take <i>S</i> to be a singleton whose element has maximum possible
order in <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>.)<br>
<b>Problem:</b> If the group generated by <i>S</i> contains a fixed-point-free
element, can we always find one which is a word of polynomially bounded length?
