<a name="H1"><b>Problem 1.</b></a> 
In 1956, Rudin defined a permutation of the integers which maps
3<I>x</I> to 2<I>x</I>, 3<I>x</I>+1 to 4<I>x</I>+1, and
3<I>x</I>-1 to 4<I>x</I>-1 for all <I>x</I>. <EM> Problem:</EM>
Determine the cycle structure of this permutation.

<P>

I have just learned (December 1998) that this problem is older: it is
the "original Collatz problem" from the 1930s (before the famous 3<I>x</I>+1
problem). <A HREF="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/lagarias/index.html">

<a name="H2"><b>Problem 2.</b></a>
Let <I>f</I>(<I>k,n</I>) be the number of rooted trees with <I>n</I>
leaves, all at level <I>k</I> (that is, distance <I>k</I>
from the root), up to isomorphism of rooted trees.
Prove that <I>f</I>(<I>k</I>+1,<I>n</I>)/<I>f</I>(<I>k,n</I>) tends to
infinity with <I>n</I>, for fixed <I>k</I>. Is it even true that
<I>f</I>(<I>k</I>+1,<I>n</I>)/<I>f</I>(<I>k,n</I>)

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT> by Peter Johnson.

<P>

Let <I>r</I> be the maximum number of edges from a vertex on
one level to the next level, in a tree with <I>n</I> vertices
at level <I>k</I>. Then <I>r<SUP>k</SUP></I> is at least <I>n</I>,
so <I>r</I> is at least <I>n</I><SUP>1/<I>k</I></SUP>.

<P>

From any tree of height <I>k</I>+1, we obtain at most <I>k</I>
different trees of height <I>k</I> by suppressing one level (replacing the
paths of length 2 crossing this level by single edges).

<P>

But there is some tree of height <I>k</I>  from which at least
<I>p</I>(<I>n</I><SUP>1/<I>k</I>)</SUP> trees of height <I>k</I>+1 
can be recovered by introducing a new level. (Choose a level where some vertex
has at least <I>n</I><SUP>1/<I>k</I></SUP> upward edges; if the number of
such edges is <I>r</I>, then we can split the <I>r</I>
edges  in <I>p</I>(<I>r</I>) ways giving non-isomorphic trees. 
(Treat all the other vertices on this level alike.)

<P>

So <I>f</I>(<I>k</I>+1,<I>n</I>)/<I>f</I>(<I>k,n</I>) is at least
<I>p</I>(<I>n</I><SUP>1/<I>k</I></SUP>)/<I>k</I>.

<EM>Problem:</EM> Find a bijective proof.

<P>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT> by Jeannette Janssen:

<P>

Use the terms S-sequence and U-sequence for the sequences counted
by <I>s</I>(<I>n</I>)  and  <I>u</I>(<I>n</I>). The left-hand side of the
equality counts U-sequences ending in <I>n</I>; removing the last
term gives a U-sequence with sum less than <I>n</I>.

<P>

Given an S-sequence, we can add or remove 1 without changing the
S-sequence property. So the right-hand side counts S-sequences
containing 1.

<P>

Now take one of these U-sequences, say <I>u</I><SUB>1</SUB>,
<I>u</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ...; the corresponding S-sequence is
1, 1+<I>u</I><SUB>1</SUB>, 1+<I>u</I><SUB>1</SUB>+<I>u</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ...

<a name="H7"><b>Problem 7.</b></a>
A triangular prism made of uniform material has cross-section with
sides <I>a</I>, <I>b</I> and <I>c</I> (not necessarily
equal). It is rolled along a smooth plane so that it rotates about
its axis. It gradually loses energy (because of air resistance).
What are the probabilities that it lands on each of the three
faces (in terms of <I>a</I>, <I>b</I> and <I>c</I>)?

<P>

There are obviously some points of detail in the physics to discuss.
Dima Fon-Der-Flaass has an argument to show that, if the loss of
energy is infinitesimally slow, and the triangle has unequal sides, then
the probabilities are either 1/2, 1/4, 1/4 or 1/2, 1/2, 0.

<P>

This assumption is not physically realistic. Paul Glendinning found the
even more surprising result that there is a collection of non-trivial
intervals, arbitrarily close to 0, such that if the dissipation rate
<I>d</I> lies in one of these intervals, then the probabilities
are 1, 0, 0 for almost all initial conditions; that is, there is one
face on which the prism is almost certain to land. See
P. Glendinning, Inaccessible attractors of weakly dissipative systems,
<I>Nonlinearity</I> <B>10</B> (1997), 507-522. 

<P>

Franco Vivaldi pointed out that, if instead the prism is turned to a random
orientation and dropped onto a plane covered with glue, then the
probabilities are proportional to the angles subtended by the sides
at the centroid of the triangle.

<a name="H8"><b>Problem 8.</b></a>
It can be shown that, if <I>F<SUB>i</SUB></I> is the number of 
orbits of a
finite permutation group <I>G</I> on <I>i</I>-tuples of distinct
elements, then the proportion of elements of <I>G</I> which are
derangements (have no fixed points) is the alternating sum of the
quantities <I>F<SUB>i</I></SUB>/<I>i</I>!. (See
N. Boston, W. Dabrowski, T. Foguel, P. J. Gies, J. Leavitt, D. T. Ose
and D. A. Jackson,
The proportion of fixed-point-free elements of a transitive permutation
group, <I>Communications in Algebra</I> <B>21</B> (1993), 3259-3275.)


<P>

For an infinite oligomorphic group (one with <I>F<SUB>i</SUB></I> finite for
all <I>i</I>), the alternating sum may make sense (i.e. it may
converge, or some other summation method may apply), even though the
proportion of derangements does not. <EM>Problem:</EM> What does this
mean?

<P>

For example, in the infinite symmetric group, <I>F<SUB>i</SUB></I>=1 for
all <I>i</I>, and the sum is 1/e, which is just the
limiting proportion of derangements in finite symmetric groups.

<P>

A more mysterious example is the group of order preserving permutations
of the rational numbers. Here, <I>f<SUB>i</SUB>=i</I>! for all <I>i</I>,
and the sum is 1-1+1-1...=1/2 (according to Euler). In what sense are
half of the order-preserving permutations derangements?

<a name="H9"><b>Problem 9.</b></a>
(A. D. Keedwell). Suppose that <I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, ...,
<I>x<SUB>m</SUB></I>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>, ..., 
<I>y<SUB>n</SUB></I> are positive integers such that there
exists a bipartite graph with vertex degrees <I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, ...,
<I>x<SUB>m</SUB></I> in one bipartite block and <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>, ..., 
<I>y<SUB>n</SUB></I> in the other. (This is equivalent to asserting that the
conditions of the Gale-Ryser theorem are satisfied.) Suppose
further that all the <I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I> and <I>y<SUB>j</SUB></I> are
greater than 1. Show that there is a bipartite graph having 
these vertex degrees, which has two proper edge-colourings
such that
<UL>
<LI> for any vertex, the sets of colours appearing on edges
at that vertex are the same in both colourings;
<LI> no edge receives the same colour in both colourings.
</UL>
Note: it is not true that any graph with these vertex-degrees
has such a pair of colourings. A counterexample is given by the
two degree sequences (3,2,2,2) and (3,2,2,2), when the graph
consisting of two 4-cycles joined by an edge does not have such
a pair of colourings (though the graph consisting of two vertices
joined by three disjoint paths of length 3 has such the same
degree sequences and does have such colourings.
<P>
The conjecture is true if the degrees are all equal, or if every
degree is either 2 or 3.

<B>Problem.</B> Find a "counting proof" of this identity.<P>

This problem is due to Alastair King and Andrew Swann. I heard it from
<A HREF="http://www2.bath.ac.uk/~masgcs/home.html">Geoff Smith</A>.
A <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~omer/bij.ps">solution</A> was found by 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~omer/">Omer Egecioglu</A>.
Subsequently, <A HREF="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~rjc/rjc.html">Robin
Chapman</A> told me that the result is due to Daniel J. Kleitman,
A note on some subset identites,
<I>Studies in Applied Mathematics</I>
LIV 289-293 (1975). Then an even earlier `proof' was unearthed in
W. Feller's classic <I>An Introduction to Probability Theory
and its Applications</I>, by
<A HREF=mailto:a.d.king@maths.bath.ac.uk>Alastair King</A>.
Here are his comments (with an addition by Robin Chapman):

<P>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT>: As observed by Kleitman, the 
"central binomial convolution identity"
amounts to the fact that the number of balanced +1/-1 sequences 
(random walks) is equal to the number of never balanced ones 
of the same length.

<P>

A simple combinatorial proof of this fact can be extracted 
from the probability literature:

<P>

W. Feller, <I>An Introduction to Probability Theory
 and its Applications</I>, Wiley, New York, 1950.

<P>

The result plays a fundamental role in the analysis of
random walks (Main Lemma III.3.1). The proof given 
in the text is not strictly combinatorial, but Problem III.10.7 
asks for a purely combinatorial proof and sketches the construction
of a bijection which is attributed to E. Nelson.
Confusingly, the sketch appears to construct a bijection with
another set of random walks of the same size, namely 
those which are non-negative.
However, a small modification yields the following:

<P>

Identify the "initial" segment of a walk as being:
<UL>
<LI> for a balanced walk, up to the first time it reaches either
  <UL>
  <LI> its minimum value for walks that start -1 or
  <LI> its maximum value for walks that start +1,
  </UL>
<LI> for a never balanced walk,  up to the last time it reaches half its 
final value
  <UL>
  <LI> with a +1 for walks that start with +1 or
  <LI> with a -1 for walks that start with -1.
  </UL>
</UL>
The bijection reverses the signs and order of the initial segment.

<P>

<B>Note:</B> the first and last steps in an initial segment have the same sign.
Thus balanced walks that start -1 correspond to never balanced
ones that start +1 (and vice versa).

<a name="H14"><b>Problem 14.</b></a>
Two problems on designs and partitions.

<P>

1. Is it possible to partition the 4-subsets of a 16-set into 13
sets of 140 subsets, each set isomorphic to the set of planes in 
the affine space AG(4,2)? 

<P>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT>: Rudi Mathon informs me that Luc 
Teirlinck has shown the non-existence of such a partition. I will add the

Of course, one can now ask for a partition of the 4-subsets of a 32-set into
29 copies of AG(5,2).

<P>

2. Is there a Steiner system S(3,5,26) (a set of 5-subsets of a 26-set
with the property that any 3 points lie in just one of them) having the
property that there are no three of the blocks which have pairwise
intersections of size 2 but the intersection of all three is empty?
Such a design would give rise to a strongly regular graph on 352 vertices

<a name="H15"><b>Problem 15.</b></a>
<EM> Two problems on random Latin squares </EM>

<P>

1. Call a row of a Latin square <EM>even</EM> or <EM>odd</EM> according
as it is an even or an odd permutation of the set {1,2,...,<I>n</I>}.
Prove that the number of even rows of a random Latin square of order
<I>n</I> is approximately binomial <I>B</I>(<I>n</I>,1/2).
(The best result in this direction is due to 
R. H&auml;ggkvist and J. Janssen,
<I>Discrete Mathematics</I> <B>157</B> (1996), 199-206:
the probability that all rows are even is exponentially small.)

<P>

2. Define a probability measure on permutations of {1,2,...,<I>n</I>}
as follows: the probability of a permutation is the proportion of
Latin squares with first row (1,2,...,<I>n</I>) in which it occurs
as the second row. What can be said about this distribution? (For
example, a permutation has non-zero probability if and only if it
is a derangement.) In particular, prove that the probability that
a permutation lies in no transitive proper subgroup of the symmetric group
except possibly the alternating group tends to 1 as <I>n</I> approaches
infinity.

<P>

(The analogous result for the uniform distribution was proved by
T. Luczak and L. Pyber, <I>Combinatorics, Probability and Computing</I>
<B>2</B> (1993), 505-512. Their result gives a simple deduction that
the group generated by the rows of a random Latin square is almost
surely the symmetric group. A solution to this problem would give
the same conclusion for a random "normalised" Latin square.)

<P>

<i>Note added 28 July 2005</i>: I now believe that the distribution defined
here "approaches" the uniform distribution on derangements as <i>n</i> grows.
For example, when <i>n</i>=7, the numbers of ways of extending a two-rowed
Latin rectangle corresponding to each type of derangement (with cycle lengths
7, 2+5, 2+2+3, and 3+4 respectively) are 6566400, 6604800, 6635520, and
6543360 respectively.

<a name="H16"><b>Problem 16.</b></a>
Find all positive integers greater than two which can be written as the sum

<HR>

<a name="H17"><b>Problem 17.</b></a>
It is known that the average number of ways in which a positive integer

Is it true that the limiting distribution of the number of representations
of this form is Poisson with parameter log<SUB>e</SUB>2? 

<P>

This would imply
that the density of the set of numbers with no such representation is 1/2.
It would also imply that there exist integers with arbitrarily many such
representations. Either of these assertions would be a nice result!

Any positive integer can be written uniquely as the sum of non-consecutive

function</EM> on the natural numbers by taking this expression and "moving
each Fibonacci number along one". So, for example, 40 = 34 + 5 + 1; its
Fibonacci successor is 55 + 8 + 2 = 65.

<P>

Now produce a table in which each row begins with the smallest number which
doesn't occur in any earlier row, and all further entries are obtained by
applying the Fibonacci successor function. (So the top row consists of
the Fibonacci numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...; the next begins 4, 7, 11, ...)
It turns out that if we extrapolate each row back two steps using the
recurrence relation for the Fibonacci numbers, we obtain the natural
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ...; this gives a convenient numbering of the rows.
Every positive integer occurs exactly once in this table, and every
sequence of positive integers satisfying the Fibonacci recurrence relation
agrees from some point on with a row of the table.

<P>

Now let <I>x<SUB>n</SUB></I> denote the fractional part of <I>n</I>
times the golden ratio. Let <I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I> and <I>b<SUB>n</SUB></I>
be the number of earlier terms of this sequence to the left and the right
respectively of <I>x<SUB>n</SUB></I> (including 0 and 1). The sequence of
pairs (<I>a<SUB>n</SUB></I>, <I>b<SUB>n</SUB></I>) begins
(1,1), (1,2), (3,1), (2,3), (1,5), (5,2), ...

<P>

If we look at the pairs occurring in the Fibonacci-numbered positions, we
see (1,1), (1,2), (3,1), (1,5), ... In other words, one number in the pair
is 1, and it bounces from side to side as we progress along the sequence.
This follows from well-known properties of the continued fraction expansion
of the golden ratio.

<P>

<EM>Problems.</EM> If we consider the pairs in the positions numbered by
any fixed row in the table, show that there is a "bouncing number" which
alternates sides in the pairs. Which numbers occur as "bouncing numbers"?

<P>

For example: row number 1 of the table is 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ...; the pairs
in these positions are (2,3), (3,5), (9,3), (3,16), (27,3), ...; so the
"bouncing number" is 3. The "bouncing numbers" for rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
appear to be 1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 5, 9, ...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT>:
The answer to this question is negative. The smallest counterexamples
have order 128, and there are two of them. This was found by Alexander
Hulpke and Andreas Caranti. Alexander provided the following example in GAP:

<PRE>

gap> g:=SmallGroup(128,36);

[ false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false ]

</PRE>

If not, is the following weaker statement true?

<BLOCKQUOTE>

	If <I>P</I> is a 2-group which is not elementary abelian, and
	<I>Q</I> is a core-free subgroup of <I>P</I>, then there is an
	element lying in no conjugate of <I>Q</I> which is a square.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Avinoam Mann also suggested the above group as a possible counterexample to the
second question. However, Steve Linton and John Murray both checked that
there is no core-free subgroup Q for which it is a counterexample. So
the question is still open.

<P>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Solution</FONT> (13 September 2004): 
The answer to the second question is also
negative. Pablo Spiga found that the group of order 128 with generators
(1,2,7,3)(4,8)(5,11)(6,9)(10,14)(12,16,13,15),
(1,4,7,5)(2,8)(3,11)(6,13,14,12)(9,15)(10,16), and
(1,6)(2,9,3,10)(4,12,5,13)(7,14)(8,15)(11,16)
is a counterexample. Indeed, in this group the set of elements with
fixed points coincides with the set of squares. This group is
<TT>SmallGroup(128,836)</TT> in the GAP library.

A <EM>symmetric graph design</EM>, or SGD, with parameters

To avoid degenerate cases, we assume that <I>X</I> is neither the

In this case, condition 2 follows from conditions 1 and 3.

Dima Fon-Der-Flaass has shown that condition 1 does not follow from 2 and 3.
An example for &lambda;=2: it is easy to find <I>n</I> subgraphs of
<I>K<SUB>n</SUB></I>, each having <I>n</I>-1 edges, in such a way that
every edge belongs to exactly two of them, and every two subgraphs have a
single edge in common. The subgraphs can be arbitrary.

<P>

<A HREF=mailto:spados@katamail.com>Santi Spadaro</A> points out that 3 does
not follow from 1 and 2, essentially because we can take a symmetric graph
design and choose an arbitrary subset of the graphs <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I>.
Moreover, 2 does not follow from 1 and 3: take all graphs on <I>n</I>
vertices isomorphic to a fixed graph <I>X</I>; then 1 and 3 hold but 2
usually fails. This problem is now completely settled in the

R. D. Carmichael defined a <EM>primitive lambda-root</EM> or PLR of <I>n</I>
to be an element of <I>U</I>(<I>n</I>) (the group of units modulo <I>n</I>)
whose order is equal to the exponent of <I>U</I>(<I>n</I>). It is possible to
count the number of PLRs of <I>n</I>, for any <I>n</I>. Donald Preece asked:
is it possible to count the number of PLRs <I>x</I> having the property that
<I>x</I>-1 is a unit? In particular, for which <I>n</I> do all (resp. some,
none) of the PLRs have this property?

<a name="H42"><b>Problem 42.</b></a>
This problem was suggested by Donald Preece.

<P>

Following Carmichael, a <EM>primitive lambda-root</EM> of <I>n</I> is
a unit in the integers modulo <I>n</I> which has the largest possible
order. Let <I>F</I>(<I>n</I>) be the number of primitive lambda-roots
of <I>n</I>. If primitive roots of <I>n</I> exist (that is, if <I>n</I>
is an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power, or 4), then
<I>F</I>(<I>n</I>)=<I>phi</I>(<I>phi</I>(<I>n</I>)), where <I>phi</I>
is Euler's totient function. However, this
equation holds for other numbers too; indeed, it is true for more than
half of the integers up to a million. In general, the left-hand side is
at least as large as the right-hand side.

<P>

<B>Problem:</B> Is it true that the proportion of natural numbers for which
the equation <I>F</I>(<I>n</I>)=<I>phi</I>(<I>phi</I>(<I>n</I>)) holds tends
to a non-zero limit? If so, what is the limit?

<a name="H45"><b>Problem 45.</b></a>
This problem is due to Patrick Moss, in his Ph.D. thesis (University of East
Anglia 2003). A sequence (<i>u</i>(<i>n</i>)) of non-negative integers
is said to be <em>realizable</em> if there is a set <i>X</i> and a permutation
<i>T</i> of <i>X</i> such that <i>u</i>(<i>n</i>) is the number of fixed
points of <i>T<sup>n</sup></i> in <i>X</i>. Moss shows indirectly that, if
(<i>u</i>(<i>n</i>)) is realizable, then so are the sequences
(<i>u</i>(<i>n</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup>) and (<i>u</i>(<i>n<sup>k</sup></i>)),
where <i>k</i> is a fixed positive integer. <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Find
a pair (<i>X',T'</i>) realizing each of these sequences, in terms of the
pair (<i>X,T</i>) realizing the original sequence.

<P>

The first sequence is not likely to be easy. For example, let <i>p</i> be a 
prime. The constant sequence with value <i>p</i> is realized by the identity 
permutation of a set of size <i>p</i>. An obvious realization of the sequence
(<i>p<sup>n</sup></i>) is (<i>X,T</i>), where <i>X</i> is the algebraic
closure of the field with <i>p</i> elements and <i>T</i> is the Frobenius map
<i>T</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>x<sup>p</sup></i>.

<P>

The second, however, is reasonably straightforward. Indeed, let <i>f</i> be
a function on the natural numbers such that <i>n</i> divides <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>),
and suppose that there is a function <i>g</i> such that <i>g</i>(<i>m</i>)
divides <i>n</i> if and only if <i>m</i> divides <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>). Then
a realization of (<i>u</i>(<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>))) can be constructed directly
from a realization of (<i>u</i>(<i>n</i>)). The function
<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)=<i>n<sup>k</sup></i> has these properties.
The proof is <a href="preprints/pmp.pdf">here</a>.

So let me pose a further question. Is there such a square in which the graph
with vertex set {1,...,9}, two vertices joined if they lie in five blocks,
is the "window graph" (the line graph of <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>, or the
Paley graph of order 9)?

<p>

Added 05/12/2005: This too can be done. So one more test: is there a square 
in which the short rows and short columns are separately nearly balanced?
Perhaps one could ask whether each pair of numbers lies in 2 or 3 short rows
and 2 or 3 short columns, total 4 or 5? But a computation shows that this is 
not possible! In fact we cannot place more than five numbers subject to these
constraints without getting stuck.

<P>

Also, one can find such a square where the block concurrences are 3 and 6,
or 2 and 7, or 0 and 9, but not 1 or 8.
<P>

<a name="H58"><b>Problem 58.</b></a>
Let <b>F</b> be the set of sequences <i>F</i> of positive integers whose 
<i>n</i>th term is the number of orbits on <i>n</i>-tuples of distinct elements
of an infinite permutation group.

<p>

<i>Is <b>F</b> closed under pointwise multiplication?</i>

<p>

I conjecture that the answer is "no". Specifically, let <i>F</i> be the
sequence (1,2,4,10,26,...) whose <i>n</i>th term is the number of solutions of 
<i>g</i><sup>2</sup>=1 in the symmetric group of degree <i>n</i>. This
sequence belongs to <b>F</b>, but I conjecture that the sequence 
(1,4,16,100,676...)
whose terms are the squares of the terms in this sequence is not in <b>F</b>.

<p>

<b>Remark:</b> The set of sequences counting orbits of permutation groups on
all <i>n</i>-tuples is closed under pointwise multiplication. Moreover, the
set of sequences counting orbits on <i>n</i>-tuples of distinct elements for
groups with the property that the stabiliser of a finite set fixes no
additional points is closed under pointwise multiplication.

<P>

<b>Further remark:</b> The answer in general is "no": if <i>G</i> is the
stabiliser of a point in the symmetric group, the sequence begins 2, 3, 4, ...,
but a group with 4 orbits on points must have at least 12 orbits on ordered
pairs of distinct points. It is harder for transitive groups
(where a possible counterexample is given in the question), and still more so
for primitive groups.

Let <i>n</i> be a positive integer. A linear car park has <i>n</i> spaces
numbered 1,2,...,<i>n</i>. Each of <i>n</i> drivers independently chooses
a favourite parking space. In turn, each driver enters the car park, goes
to his chosen space, and parks there if it is free; if not, he takes
the first available space. If he reaches the end of the car park without
finding a space, he leaves in disgust. It is known that, of the
<i>n<sup>n</sup></i> possible choices by the drivers, exactly
(<i>n</i>+1)<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> result in all drivers parking successfully.

For a graph <i>G</i>, let <i>a</i>&#176;(<i>G</i>) be the greatest integer 
<i>k</i> such that, for any circular ordering of the vertices of <i>G</i>, 
there is a monotonic cycle with <i>k</i> vertices. (An edge counts as a cycle 
of length 2 here.) This parameter is related to the <i>altitude</i> of <i>G</i>
investigated by Mynhardt <i>et&nbsp;al.</i> It is easy to see that

Perhaps the time has come to revisit this conjecture.

The most extreme example I know is an extension of a 2<i>n</i>-dimensional
vector space over GF(2) by a dihedral group of order
2(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>+1); this has rank 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> and subrank
2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup>+1. So perhaps the conjecture holds with a linear

A <i>homomorphism</i> of graphs is a mapping of vertices which carries

a graph is a core if all its self-homomorphisms are automorphisms. For any

Do there exist infinitely many non-abelian finite simple groups whose order

<p>
The context is a theorem of Cauchy which states that a primitive permutation
group of degree prime plus one is doubly transitive. Neumann, Sims and Wiegold
pointed out in 1968 that this is false: if <i>S</i> is a non-abelian finite
simple group, then <i>S</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>S</i>, acting on <i>S</i>
by left and right multiplication, is primitive but not doubly transitive.
The first few finite simple groups have order a prime plus one. So the
question asks whether this construction gives infinitely many counterexamples
to Cauchy's "theorem".

<p>
In connection with optimality of block designs, statisticians are interested
in various functions of the Laplacian eigenvalues of a graph. If the graph
is connected, then 0 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity 1; the other
eigenvalues are called <i>non-trivial</i>, and are strictly positive.
The most interesting are:
<ul>
<li> the harmonic mean of the non-trivial eigenvalues (for A-optimality);</li>
<li> the geometric mean of the non-trivial eigenvalues (for D-optimality);</li>
<li> the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue (for E-optimality).</li>
</ul>
See my forthcoming paper with R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Bailey on "Combinatorics of
optimal designs".
</p>

<p> 
The geometric mean is determined by the Tutte polynomial of the graph --
it is essentially the number of spanning trees. <b>Problem</b>: Is it true
that the other two are not determined by the Tutte polynomial, i.e. they
may take different values for graphs with the same Tutte polynomial?
</p>

<p>
<b>Solution:</b> This is indeed true. Emil Vaughan pointed out to me that any
tree on <i>n</i> vertices has Tutte polynomial <i>x<sup>n</sup></i>, whereas
trees certainly differ on the other criteria (the star being optimal).
</p>

<p>
In the reverse direction, the two strongly regular graphs on 16 points (the
line graph of <i>K</i><sub>4,4</sub> and the Shrikhande graph) have the same
Laplace eigenvalues (and so agree on all eigenvalue-based optimality criteria)
but different Tutte polynomials (the first has 576 proper 4-colourings, the

before looking up references.

A library has <i>n</i> books, stacked up in piles, so there are
<i>p</i>(<i>n</i>) possibilities for the sizes of the piles (the integer
partition function). Every day, the librarian comes in and picks up the top
book from each pile, making a new pile from these books. This defines a map
on the set of integer partitions. Now many questions can be asked, such as
<ul>
<li> How many connected components are there?</li>
<li> What are the cycle lengths?</li>
<li> What is the maximum number of days before a partition is repeated?</li>
<li> How many periodic points are there?

Donald Preece and I have failed to solve the following problem.
</p>
<p>
Let <i>p</i> be an odd prime, and <i>k</i> an integer at least 3. A
<i>k-AP decomposition</i> mod <i>p</i> is an arithmetic progression
<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<i>a<sub>k</sub></i>
consisting of integers not congruent to 0 or 1 mod&nbsp;<i>p</i> such that the
group of units of <b>Z</b><sub><i>p</i></sub> is the direct product by the
cyclic groups generated by the terms of the progression.
</p>
<p>
There are many examples of 3-AP decompositions, but we found no 4-AP
decompositions; none exist for primes less than 20000.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Do <i>k</i>-AP decompositions exist for <i>k</i>&gt;3?
</p>
<p>(Note: we assume that each cyclic factor has order greater than 1.
Without this assumption, the AP [3528,1148,2381,1] mod 3613 is an example.)</p>

A group <i>G</i> is a <em>B-group</em> if every primitive permutation group
containing the regular representation of <i>G</i> is doubly transitive.
There are many finite B-groups (including cyclic groups of composite order),
but no countably infinite B-groups are known.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Does there exist a countably infinite B-group?</li>
<li> Let <i>G</i> be the infinite <em>dicyclic group</em>, generated by two
elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, where <i>b</i> has order 4 and inverts
<i>a</i>. Is <i>G</i> a B-group?
(Note that the countable random graph is not a Cayley graph for <i>G</i>; so
the standard method for showing a group is not a B-group fails!)</li>

<p>
The <em>power graph</em> of a group is the undirected graph whose
vertex set is the group, two elements being adjacent if one is a power of the
other.
</p>
<p>
Two finite abelian groups with isomorphic power graphs must be isomorphic, but
this is not true for arbitrary finite groups.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conjecture:</b> Two finite groups with isomorphic power graphs have
the same number of elements of each order.
</p>

<p>
This problem has been solved in the affirmative. A stronger statement holds.
If the power graphs are isomorphic, then the <em>directed power graphs</em>
(with a directed edge from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> if <i>y</i> is a power of
<i>x</i>) are also isomorphic. The proof will appear in <i>J. Group Theory</i>,

This problem is due to Josephine Kusuma.
</p>
<p>
It is well known that the strength (as an orthogonal array) of a linear
code over a field is one less than the minimum Hamming weight of
the dual code. Josephine showed that this is true over arbitrary commutative
rings with identity.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Let <i>C</i> be a linear code over <b>Z</b><sub>4</sub>,
and let <i>C</i>' be its Gray map image. Is it true that the strength of
<i>C</i>' is one less than the minimum Lee weight of the dual of <i>C</i>?
(Josephine also showed that this holds with "is at most" replacing "is".)
</p>
<p>
(The Gray map from <b>Z</b><sub>4</sub> to <b>Z</b><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>
is defined coordinatewise, and maps 0 to 00, 1 to 01, 2 to 11, and 3 to 10.
The Lee distance on <b>Z</b><sub>4</sub> is given by
<i>d<sub>L</sub></i>(<i>x,y</i>)=min(<i>x-y,y-x</i>). The Gray map is an

Suppose that <i>k</i> is a proper divisor of <i>n</i>. Let <i>S</i> consist
of all those integers between 2 and <i>n</i>&ndash;1 inclusive which are
either a multiple of <i>k</i>, or at least <i>n</i>/<i>k</i> (or both).
Let <i>q</i>(<i>n</i>) denote the minimum of |<i>S</i>|/<i>n</i>, over all

<p>
A graph <i>X</i> is a <em>hull</em> if, for any two non-adjacent vertices
<i>v</i> and <i>w</i>, there is an endomorphism of <i>X</i> (a homomorphism
from <i>X</i> to itself) which maps <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> to the same place.
</p>
<p>
It is known that any countably infinite graph with infinite clique size is
a hull.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Let <i>X</i> be a countably infinite hull with finite clique
size &omega;(<i>X</i>). Is it true that &chi;(<i>X</i>)=&omega;(<i>X</i>)
(where &chi;(<i>X</i>) is the chromatic number of <i>X</i>)?
</p>

<p>
<b>Solution by Nick Gravin:</b> Take any finite subgraph <i>Y</i>. If it is
not a complete graph, we can collapse two of its vertices by an endomorphism
of <i>X</i>. If the image is not complete, we can collapse two more. We end
with a homomorphism from <i>Y</i> to a complete graph, so the chromatic number
of <i>Y</i> is at most &omega;(<i>X</i>). Since this holds for all finite
subgraphs, a compactness argument shows that 
&chi;(<i>X</i>)&le;&omega;(<i>X</i>), and so equality holds.

<p>
(An update of Problem 85.) A magma (a set with a binary operation) is 
<i>power-associative</i> if the value of a power <i>a<sup>n</sup></i> is 
independent of the bracketing used to calculate it. The <i>directed power
graph</i> of a power-associative  magma is the digraph whose vertices are 
the elements of the magma, an edge from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> if <i>b</i> is
a power of <i>a</i>; the <i>undirected power graph</i> has an undirected edge 
connecting <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> if one is a power of the other.
</p>
<p>
It is known that if two groups have isomorphic undirected power graphs, then 
they have isomorphic directed power graphs. Does this hold for wider classes 
of power-associative magmas? (In particular, I conjecture that it holds for 
Moufang loops.)

<p><a name="H94"><b>Problem 94</b></a></p>

The theorem of Engeler, Ryll-Nardzewski and Svenonius asserts that, if
<i>T</i> is a first-order theory in a countable language, then <i>T</i> is
countably categorical (that is, all its countable models are isomorphic)
if and only if the automorphism group of any countable model is oligomorphic
(that is, has only finitely many orbits on <i>n</i>-tuples, for all
<i>n</i>).
</p>
<p>
Sam Tarzi has asked whether an analogous result holds for homomorphisms and
monoids. Let <i>T</i> have the property that all its countable models are
<i>hom-equivalent</i> (that is, there exist homomorphisms in both directions
between any two). What property do the endomorphism monoids of the models
have? And does this monoid property imply that all countable models are
hom-equivalent?

The theory of graphs in which every finite set of vertices has a common neighbour has the property that all its countable models are hom-equivalent.
