<p><b>Problem 1: Random synchronization</b></p>
<p>
Choose two maps from the set {1,&hellip;,<i>n</i>} to itself at random.
Does the probability that the semigroup they generate is <em>synchronizing</em>
(i.e. contains an element of rank 1) tend to 1 as <i>n</i>&rarr;&infin;?
<p>
A paper by Mikhail Berlinkov in <em>Algorithms and Discrete Applied
Mathematics</em>, LNCS <b>9602</b> (2016), 73-84, gives an affirmative
solution to this question (the preprint is
<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5774v1.pdf">arXiv 1304.5774</a>).
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 2: Hot and cold matrices</b></p>
<p>
This problem was suggested to me by Dennis Lin.
</p>
<p>
Let <i>n</i> be congruent to 2 mod 4. Define a <em>cold matrix</em> to be a
skew-symmetric matrix of order <i>n</i> with (0 diagonal and) &plusmn;1
off-diagonal, and a <em>hot matrix</em> to be a matrix with +1 on the diagonal
and otherwise skew-symmetric with entries &plusmn;1. Thus, <i>C</i> is cold if
and only if <i>C</i>+<i>I</i> is hot. (The names arise because of the
motivation from conference and Hadamard matrices.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Conjecture:</b> <i>C</i> has maximum determinant among cold matrices of
order <i>n</i> if and only if <i>C</i>+<i>I</i> has maximum determinant among
hot matrices of order <i>n</i>.

<p><b>Problem 3: Symmetry of switching classes</b></p>
<p>
Here are three problems on switching of graphs and tournaments (two of them
solved). This replaces Problems 3, 8 and 9 on the original list, resulting in
some re-numbering.
<p>
Let <i>X</i> be a graph on the vertex set <i>V</i>. The operation of
<em>switching</em> <i>X</i> with respect to a subset <i>A</i> of <i>V</i>
involves changing all edges between <i>A</i> and its complement into
non-edges, and all non-edges into edges, while leaving adjacency within
<i>A</i> or its complement unaltered. Switching is an equivalence relation
on the set of graphs on <i>V</i>, whose equivalence classes are called
<em>switching classes</em>.
</p>
<p>
We can define the <em>automorphism group</em> of a switching class in the
obvious way; it contains the automorphism groups of the graphs in the class
as subgroups.
</p>
<p>
For tournaments, switching is very similarly defined, but instead of switching
edges and non-edges, we reverse the directions of edges. Switching classes
and automorphism groups work in the same way.
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Problem</b>: Show that, with the exception of the switching classes of the
complete and null graphs and finitely many others, a switching class whose
automorphism group is primitive contains a graph whose automorphism group
is trivial. Find all the finitely many exceptions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b> This problem has been solved by Pablo Spiga and me, see
<em>Australas. J. Combinatorics</em> <b>62</b> (2015), 76-90: 
<a href="http://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/62/ajc_v62_p076.pdf">full text here</a>.
There are just six exceptions up to complementation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Is it true that, with the exception of the switching classes of
the complete and null graphs and finitely many others, a switching class whose
automorphism group is primitive contains a graph with trivial endomorphism
monoid, with finitely many exceptions?
</p>
<p>
This is likely to be more difficult.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Now we turn to switching classes of tournaments. 
</p>
<p>
It is known that a necessary condition for a permutation group <i>G</i> to be the automorphism group of a switching class of tournaments
 is that the Sylow 2-subgroups of <i>G</i> are cyclic or dihedral and act semiregularly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Can one classify, for example, the <em>primitive</em> groups for which this condition is not sufficient?
</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Yes. A primitive group fixes a switching class of tournaments if and only if <em>either</em> it has odd degree and odd order
 (and so fixes a tournament), <em>or</em> it has degree <i>q</i>+1 and lies between PSL(2,<i>q</i>) and P&Sigma;L(2,<i>q</i>), where <i>q</i> is a
 prime congruent to 3 (mod&nbsp;4).
</p
 
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 4: Acyclic orientations</b></p>
<p>
(with Celia Glass and Robert Schumacher) Is it true that, for <i>n</i> even, the graph with <i>n</i> vertices and <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4 edges with
 the maximum number of acyclic orientations (among such graphs) is the complete bipartite graph <i>K</i><sub><i>n</i>/2,<i>n</i>/2</sub>? (We know the
 number for complete bipartite graphs: it is a poly-Bernoulli number with negative index.)
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 5: A curious recursion</b></p>
<p>
Given positive integers <i>k,a,b</i>, with <i>a</i>&gt;<i>b</i>, define a function <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>f<sub>k,a,b</sub></i>(<i>n</i>) by the
 recursion
</p>
<p align="center">
<i>f</i>(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>k</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lceil;<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>&minus;1)(<i>a</i>+<i>n</i>)/(<i>b</i>+<i>n</i>)&rceil;&nbsp;&nbsp;for <i>n</i>&gt;0.
</p>
<p>
How does this function behave for large <i>n</i>? If it were not for the ceilings, it would grow like
 (<i>k</i>/(<i>b</i>+1)&hellip;<i>a</i>)<i>n<sup>a&minus;b</sup></i>. So we might guess that
 <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)/<i>n<sup>a&minus;b</sup></i> tends to a limit. For <i>a</i>=4, <i>b</i>=2, and <i>k</i>=1,&hellip;,12, the limit appears to be
 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 1, 1, 1; then adding 12 to <i>k</i> appears to add 1 to the limit.
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 6: Endomorphisms and partial isomorphisms</b></p>
<p>
Given a finite group <i>G</i>, let End(<i>G</i>) be the semigroup of
endomorphisms of <i>G</i>, and PIso(<i>G</i>) the semigroup of partial
isomorphisms of <i>G</i> (isomorphisms between subgroups of <i>G</i>).
</p>
<p>
If <i>G</i> is abelian, then |End(<i>G</i>)|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|PIso(<i>G</i>)|. <em>Does the converse hold?</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 7: Connection number and M&ouml;bius function</b></p>
<p>
There is a well-known connection between the three polyhedral groups on the
one hand, and the exceptional root lattices <i>E</i><sub>6</sub>,
<i>E</i><sub>7</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>8</sub> on the other. (See the McKay
correspondence and various results in singularity theory).
</p>
<p>
For a finite group <i>G</i>, let <i>n</i>(<i>G</i>) denote
|<i>G</i>|/&mu;(1,<i>G</i>), where &mu; is the M&ouml;bius function
of the subgroup lattice of <i>G</i>.
</p>
<p>
Is it just coincidence that, ignoring signs, the values of <i>n</i>(<i>G</i>)
for the three polyhedral groups are equal to the connection numbers of the
corresponding root lattices (the index in the dual lattice)? Or is there a
natural explanation? The numbers are 3, 2, 1 respectively.
</p>
<p>
A subsidiary question: If there is a natural explanation, what is the
interpretation for root lattices of the sign of the M&ouml;bius function?
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 8: A diameter question</b></p>
<p>
Given <i>n</i> and <i>k</i> with <i>k</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>n</i>, what is the smallest number <i>d</i> with the following property: given a set
 <i>S</i> of permutations of an <i>n</i>-set <i>X</i> generating a group <i>G</i>, and two <i>k</i>-subsets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> of <i>X</i> in the same
 <i>G</i>-orbit, there is a product of at most <i>d</i> elements of <i>S</i> mapping <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>.
</p>
<p>
For <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, it is clear that <i>n</i>&minus;1 suffices, and it is easy to construct examples showing this to be best possible.
</p>
<p>
I'm really interested in <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. Here <i>n</i>(<i>n</i>&minus;1)/2&minus;1 suffices, but I conjecture that the true value is much smaller
 (maybe a factor of 2 smaller?)
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 9: Groups generated by random loops</b></p>
<p>
A <em>quasigroup</em> is a finite set with a binary operation satisfying the
cancellation laws; that is, one whose Cayley table is a Latin square. A
<em>loop</em> is a quasigroup with an identity element. The
<em>multiplication group</em> of a quasigroup or loop is the group generated
by the left and right translations (which are permutations).
</p>
<p>
It is known that almost every quasigroup (that is, a proportion tending to 1 as n &rarr; &infin;) has multiplication group the symmetric group.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem</b>: Does the same statement hold for loops?
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 10: Exchange for generating sets</b></p>
<p>
This is a modification of the original Problems 12 and 13. See a forthcoming
preprint by me, Andrea Lucchini and Colva Roney-Dougal for context.
</p>
<p>
The problem is in two parts.
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
Suppose that <i>G</i> is a finite group which can be generated by <i>d</i>
elements. Is it true that, for any two elements <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> of
<i>G</i>, if
<p style="margin-left:30px;">
&lang;<i>x,S</i>&rang;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>G</i> if and only if
&lang;<i>y,S</i>&rang;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>G</i>
</p>
<p>
holds for any <i>d</i>-element subset <i>S</i> of <i>G</i>, then it holds for
any subset of arbitrary size?
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a finite group. Suppose that every non-identity element is 
contained in a 2-element generating set for <i>G</i>. Are the following two
properties equivalent for any pair <i>x,y</i> of elements of <i>G</i>?
<ul>
<li> For any element <i>z</i> of <i>G</i>,
<i>G</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;<i>x,z</i>&rang; if and only if
<i>G</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;<i>y,z</i>&rang;; </li>
<li> For any subset <i>S</i> of <i>G</i>,
<i>G</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;<i>x,S</i>&rang; if and only if
<i>G</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;<i>y,S</i>&rang;. </li>
</ul>
(It is clear that the second condition implies the first. The second holds if
and only if <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> lie in the same maximal subgroups of 
<i>G</i>.)
</p></li>
</ol></p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 11: Trees and cycles</b></p>
<p>
Given a tree <i>T</i> on vertex set {1,&hellip;,<i>n</i>}, the edges form a set of <i>n</i>&minus;1 transpositions whose product (in any order) is an
<i>n</i>-cycle. If <i>T</i> is a star, then the (<i>n</i>&minus;1)! orderings
of the edges give rise to the (<i>n</i>&minus;1)! cycles, each exactly once;
but for any other shape of tree, we do not have a bijection. e.g. for the path
on 4 vertices, of the six 4-cycles we obtain two twice, two once, and two not at all.
</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> What is the distribution of frequencies of occurrence
of cycles arising from orders of a given tree <i>T</i>?
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 12: Beyond Keevash's theorem</b></p>
<p>
Let <i>k</i> be a positive integer, and <i>I</i> a subset of {0,&hellip;,
<i>k</i>&minus;1} such that neither <i>I</i> nor its complement is empty.
For <i>n</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2<i>k</i>+1, let <i>G</i>(<i>n,k,I</i>) be the
graph whose vertex set is the set of <i>k</i>-subsets of {1,&hellip;<i>n</i>},
two subsets joined if the cardinality of their intersection is in <i>I</i>.
</p>
<p><b>Problem</b> Show that, with finitely many exceptions (for given <i>k</i>),
<i>G</i>(<i>n,k,I</i>) has clique number and chromatic number equal if and
only if there exists <i>t</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>k</i> such that
<ul>
<li> <i>I</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{<i>t</i>,&hellip;<i>k</i>&minus;1}; </li>
<li> Binom(<i>k</i>&minus;<i>i</i>,<i>t</i>&minus;<i>i</i>) divides
Binom(<i>n</i>&minus;<i>i</i>,<i>t</i>&minus;<i>i</i>) for
<i>i</i>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;<i>I</i>. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Remark</b> The second bullet point above gives the divisibility
conditions necessary for the existence of a Steiner system S(<i>t,k,n</i>).
According to the recent result of Peter Keevash, these conditions are also
asymptotically sufficient. This fact will be relevant for the proof!
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 13: Counterexamples to Cauchy's theorem</b></p>
<p>
Cauchy stated a theorem asserting that a <em>primitive</em> permutation group
(one preserving no non-trivial partition of its domain) of degree a prime plus
one is doubly transitive.
</p>
<p>
A century later, Neumann, Sims and Wiegold pointed out that this theorem is
false: if <i>S</i> is a simple group of order prime plus one, then the group
<i>S</i>&times;<i>S</i>, acting on <i>S</i> by left and right multiplication,
is primitive but not doubly transitive.
</p>
<p>
Between 4 and 1000 there are 167 numbers of the form prime plus one; of these,
five are orders of simple groups (60, 168, 360, 504, 660), and seven more are
counterexamples to the "theorem" because of other types of primitive group
(68, 84, 102, 234, 462, 620, 840). Continuing to 2500 there are two more
simple group orders (1092 and 2448) and five further counterexamples (1040,
1320, 1550, 1584 and 2162).
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Are there infinitely many numbers which provide counterexamples
to Cauchy's "theorem"? If so, what is the density of the
Neumann&ndash;Sims&ndash;Wiegold examples among them?
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 14: Agrawal's Conjecture</b></p>
<p>
Let <i>B</i> be a block of a symmetric 2-(<i>v,k</i>,&lambda;) design.
Construct a <i>k</i>&times;(<i>v</i>&minus;<i>k</i>) array as follows:
first label the blocks different from <i>B</i> with the numbers 1,&hellip;,
<i>v</i>&minus;1. The rows of the array are indexed by the points of <i>B</i>
and the columns by the points outside <i>B</i>. In the cell in row <i>p</i>
and column <i>q</i>, we put the labels of the blocks which contain <i>q</i>
but not <i>p</i>. Thus each entry is a set of size <i>k</i>&minus;&lambda;;
the union of the entries in a row has size <i>v</i>&minus;<i>k</i>, while the
union of the entries in a column has size <i>k</i>.
</p>
<p>
The problem is to produce a new array with a single entry in each cell, that
entry being chosen from the set in that position in the first array, in such
a way that the entries in any row, and the entries in any column, are all
distinct.
</p>
<p>
It is known that this is impossible for the Fano plane.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conjecture:</b> The construction above is possible in all other cases.
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 15: A universal sequence from the primes?</b></p>
<p>
A zero-one sequence is called <em>universal</em> if every finite zero-one
sequence occurs as a (consecutive) subsequence of it.
</p>
<p>
Let <i>s</i> be the sequence whose <i>n</i>th term is 0 if the <i>n</i>th odd
prime is congruent to 1 (mod&nbsp;4), and to 1 if the <i>n</i>th odd prime is
congruent to 3 (mod&nbsp;4). Is <i>s</i> universal?
</p>
<p>
Unless I am missing something, this is probably a hard problem; but in view of
the theorem of Green and Tao, it might be worth revisiting.
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 16: Random sum-free sets</b></p>
<p>
A set <i>S</i> of natural numbers is <em>sum-free</em> if it contains no solution {<i>x,y,z</i>} to <i>x</i>+<i>y</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>z</i>.
</p>
<p>
We can choose a random sum-free set as follows: Consider the natural numbers in turn. When considering <i>n</i>, if <i>n</i> is the sum of two members of <i>S</i>,
 then <i>n</i> is not in <i>S</i>; otherwise decide whether to put <i>n</i> in <i>S</i> by tossing a fair coin.
</p>
<p>
A little is known, but much is not. Let <i>S</i> be a random sum-free set.
<ul>
<li> Does <i>S</i> have a density almost surely? </li>
<li> Is the spectrum of densities discrete above 1/6? </li>
<li> Does it have a continuous part below 1/6? </li>
<li> Is the set of <em>universal</em> sum-free sets (those for which the Cayley graph Cay(<b>Z</b>,<i>S</i>) is isomorphic to Henson's universal triangle-free graph) a null set? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 17: Forbidding intersection size 1</b></p>
<p>
A very specific problem. Let <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>q</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>q</i>+1, <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>q</i>+1. If it helps, suppose that a projective plane of
 order <i>q</i> exists. Let <i>S</i> be a collection of <i>k</i>-subsets of an <i>n</i>-set <i>X</i>, with the property that the intersection of two members of <i>S</i>
 does not have cardinality 1. The size of such a set is at most
{<i>n</i>&nbsp;choose&nbsp;<i>k</i>}/<i>n</i>. Suppose that <i>S</i> attains this bound.
</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Is it true that, if <i>q</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2, then the cardinality of the intersection of two members of <i>S</i> must be at least 2?
</p>
<p>
Note that Frankl and F&uuml;redi proved an analogous result under the assumption <i>n</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;<i>n</i><sub>0</sub>(<i>k</i>) in 1983.
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 18: A reciprocity question</b></p>
<p>
The <em>cycle polynomial</em> <i>F<sub>G</sub></i>(<i>x</i>) of a
permutation group <i>G</i> is the polynomial
&sum;{<i>x</i><sup><i>c</i>(<i>g</i>)</sup>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i>},
where <i>c</i>(<i>g</i>) is the number of cycles of <i>g</i> (including fixed
points).
</p>
<p>
The <em>orbital chromatic polynomial</em>
<i>P</i><sub>&Gamma;,<i>G</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) of the graph &Gamma; and subgroup <i>G</i> of Aut(&Gamma;) is the polynomial whose value at the positive integer
<i>x</i> is the number of <i>G</i>-orbits on proper colourings of &Gamma; with
<i>x</i> colours.
</p>
<p>
We call the pair (&Gamma;,<i>G</i>) a <em>reciprocal pair</em> if 
<i>P</i><sub>&Gamma;,<i>G</i></sub>(<i>x</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(&minus;1)<sup><i>n</i></sup>|<i>G</i>|<i>F<sub>G</sub></i>(&minus;<i>x</i>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Find all reciprocal pairs.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 19: Graphs and groups</b></p>
<p>
Given a finite group <i>G</i>, we define four graphs with vertex set <i>G</i>, ordered by inclusion (i.e. the spanning subgraph relation):
<ul>
<li> &Gamma;<sub>1</sub> is the <em>power graph</em>, in which <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are joined if one is a power of the other; </li>
<li> &Gamma;<sub>2</sub> is the <em>enhanced power graph</em>, in which <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are joined if the group they generate is cyclic; </li>
<li> &Gamma;<sub>3</sub> is the <em>commuting graph</em>, in which <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are joined if they commute; </li>
<li> &Gamma;<sub>4</sub> is the <em>complement of the generating graph</em>, in which <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are joined if they do not generate <i>G</i>. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
(Note that &Gamma;<sub>4</sub> is complete if <i>G</i> is not 2-generated, and contains the commuting graph if <i>G</i> is 2-generated and non-abelian.)
</p>
There are classifications of finite groups where two of these graphs are equal (for the third and fourth, these are 2-generated non-abelian groups with
 all proper subgroups abelian, whose classification is folklore; for the others, it is in the paper of Aalipour <em>et al</em> [1].)
</p>
<p>
<b>Problems:</b>
<ol>
<li> Which finite groups have the property that &Gamma;<sub><i>i</i></sub>&nbsp;\&nbsp;&Gamma;<sub><i>i</i>&minus;1</sub> is connected (after isolated
 vertices are deleted)? </li>
<li> What can be said for infinite groups? </li>

<p><b>Problem 20: Cliques and cocliques in Cayley graphs</b></p>
<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a primitive permutation group with a regular subgroup <i>H</i>;
then we can identify the set of points permuted with <i>H</i> so that <i>H</i> 
acts on itself by right multiplication. In particular, any <i>G</i>-invariant
graph is a Cayley graph for <i>H</i>. Suppose that &Gamma; is such a graph
(not complete or null), and <i>A</i> a clique and <i>B</i> an independent set
in &Gamma; such that |<i>A</i>|&middot;|<i>B</i>|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|<i>H</i>|.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem</b>. Is it true that <i>A</i><sup>&minus;1</sup> is also a clique?
</p>
<p>
This is true if <i>G</i> contains also <i>H</i> acting by left multiplication,
so in particular if <i>H</i> is abelian. Its truth in general would resolve a
problem in synchronization theory.
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 21: Random walks on graphs on groups</b></p>
<p>
The <em>commuting graph</em> of a group <i>G</i> is the graph with vertex
set <i>G</i> in which two elements are joined whenever they commute. (This
specification includes a loop at every vertex.) The uniform random walk on
this graph has the property that its limiting distribution is <em>uniform
on conjugacy classes</em>.
</p>
<p>
To say that two elements commute is equivalent to saying that they generate
an abelian group. So we could generalise the above graph by putting different
specifications on the group generated by the two elements: for example, it is
cyclic (this gives the <em>enhanced power graph</em>), or it is the whole
group (this gives the <em>generating graph</em>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> What can be said about the uniform random walk on one of these
graphs?
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 22: Finiteness conditions for oligomorphic groups</b></p>
<p>
A group <i>G</i> is said to satisfy the finiteness condition F<sub><i>n</i></sub> if it acts geometrically (that is, properly and cocompactly) on an
 (<i>n</i>&minus;1)-connected CW-complex. It satisfies F<sub>&infin;</sub> if it satisfies F<sub><i>n</i></sub> for all <i>n</i>. Here, F<sub>1</sub>
 is equivalent to being finitely generated, and F<sub>2</sub> to being finitely presented. Finitely generated free groups satisfy F<sub>&infin;</sub>.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Houghton group</em> <i>H<sub>n</sub></i> satisfies F<sub><i>n</i></sub> but not F<sub><i>n</i>+1</sub>. Also, this group contains the
 <em>finitary symmetric group</em>, so it is <em>highly transitive</em>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Given a natural number <i>n</i>, does there exist a group <i>G</i> such that 
<ul>
<li> <i>G</i> is oligomorphic but not highly transitive (and/or contains no finitary permutation); </li>
<li> <i>G</i> satisfies F<sub><i>n</i></sub> but not F<sub><i>n</i>+1</i></sub>? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<p><b> Problem 23: A universality question for graphs on groups</b></p>
<p>
The <em>power graph</em> of a group <i>G</i> has an edge {<i>x,y</i>} if one of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is a power of the other; the <em>enhanced power
 graph</em> has an edge {<i>x,y</i>} if both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are powers of an element <i>z</i> (in other words, the group generated by <i>x</i> and
 <i>y</i> is cyclic.
</p>
<p>
It is known that the power graph is the comparability graph of a partial order (and power graphs are universal for this class: that is, for any partial
 order, the comparability graph is embeddable as induced subgraph in the power graph of some group). Moreover, enhanced power graphs of groups form a
 universal class: every finite graph can be embedded as induced subgraph in the enhanced power graph of some group.
</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Suppose we are given a colouring of the edges of a finite complete graph with three colours, red, green, and blue. Under what
 conditions is it the case that the vertices can be embedded in a finite group in such a way that red edges belong to the power graph, green edges
 to the enhanced power graph but not the power graph, and blue edges to neither?
</p>
<p>
Some conditions are necessary. The red edges must form the comparability graph of a partial order; and if {<i>x,y</i>} is green then there must exist
 <i>z</i> such that {<i>x,z</i>} and {<i>y,z</i>} are red. Are these two conditions sufficient?
</p>
<p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 24: Orderings of vector spaces</b></p>
 <p>
A (total) ordering of a finite vector space is called <em>compatible</em> if every order-preserving bijection between subspaces of the same dimension is linear.</p>
<p>
It is straightforward to show that every finite vector space has a compatible ordering: for example, choose any ordering of the finite field <i>F</i>; then the lexicographic ordering of <i>F<sup>n</sup></i> is compatible, for any <i>n</i>.
</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> How many compatible orderings does the <i>n</i>-dimensional
vector space over the field of order <i>q</i> have? (Formulae are known for the
cases <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.)

<p><b>Problem 25: Some design theory problems</b></p>
 </p>
A talk by Peter Keevash in the Pure Maths colloquium reported his successes on formerly untouchable problems in combinatorial design theory, including the
 existence of <i>t</i>-(<i>n,k,</i>&lambda;) designs (collections of <i>k</i>-subsets of an <i>n</i> set such that any <i>t</i>-subset lies in exactly
 &lambda; of them) for all values of the parameters such that the necessary divisibility conditions are satisfied and <i>n</i> is sufficiently large compared
 with the other parameters. Also, a similar result if "set", "subset" and "cardinality" are replaced by "vector space", "subspace" and "dimension" (over a
 fixed finite field). And even better, an estimate for how many such designs exist. A modification of the method deals with resolvable designs.
</p>
<p>
This led me to wonder what the big remaining challenges are. Keevash's method tends to work if the blocks are of bounded size while the number of points is
 large. So probably the major problem now in combinatorial design theory is:
</p>
<blockquote>
1. Which numbers <i>n</i> are the orders of finite projective planes?
</blockquote>
<p>
It is widely conjectured that the answer is "prime powers, and these only", though a few years ago John Thompson proposed an alternative conjecture, that the
 answer is "orders of characteristically simple groups (that is, powers of orders of simple groups), and these only. In this case the number of points is
 about <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>, while the block size is about <i>n</i>.
</p>
<p>
The smallest value which would distinguish between the two conjectures is of course 60, and I do not expect to see this resolved any time soon!
</p>
<p>
One can ask about the ultimate generalisation of resolvability. I will restrict myself to Steiner systems here (the case &lambda;=1), though the problem is
 easily generalised.
</p>
<blockquote>
2. Given <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>&lt;&hellip;&lt;<i>t<sub>m</sub></i>&lt;<i>k</i>, suppose that the divisibility conditions for S(<i>t<sub>i</sub>,k,n</i>) are
 satisfied for 1&le;<i>i</i>&le;<i>m</i>, and that <i>n</i> is sufficiently large. Does there exist a partition of the <i>k</i>-sets into
 S(<i>t<sub>m</sub>,k,n</i>) systems, each partitionable into S(<i>t</i><sub><i>m</i>&minus;1</sub>,<i>k,n</i>) systems, and so on all the way down?
</blockquote>
<p>
Finally, here is an ABC problem, named after the proposers, not the parameters in the problem. This comes from the synchronization project; the authors are
 Mohammed Aljohani, John Bamberg and I.
</p>
<blockquote>
3. Suppose that <i>I</i> is a nonempty proper subset of {0,1,&hellip;,<i>k</i>&minus;1}, and that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are are sets of <i>k</i>-subsets of
 an <i>n</i>-set, with sizes of pairwise intersections of sets in <i>A</i> belonging to <i>I</i> and those of <i>B</i> to the complement of <i>I</i>. Suppose 
 further that |<i>A</i>|&middot;|<i>B</i>| is equal to the total number of <i>k</i>-sets, and that <i>n</i> is sufficiently large. Is it true that <i>I</i>
 or its complement must be {0,1,&hellip;,<i>t</i>&minus;1)?
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that, if this holds for <i>I</i>, then <i>A</i> is a Steiner system S(<i>t,k,n</i>), and <i>B</i> an EKR family. By Keevash's result, the Steiner
 system exists if the divisibility conditions hold (and <i>n</i> is sufficiently large).

<p><b>Problem 26: On Cayley's theorem</b></p>
<p>
Cayley's Theorem in group theory states that every group of order <i>n</i> can be embedded as a subgroup of the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub>. But usually this
group is much too large.
</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> What is the size <i>F</i>(<i>n</i>) of the smallest group which embeds every group of order <i>n</i>?
</p>
<p>
In a paper with David Craven, Hamid Reza Dorbidi, Scott Harper and Benjamin Sambale, we looked at this problem, without a lot of success. For the case where <i>n</i> is a prime power <i>p<sup>m</sup></i>, we found a lower bound of <i>p</i><sup><i>cm</i><sup>2</sup></sup> and an upper bound roughly <i>p<sup>p<sup>m</sup></sup></i>.
</p>
<p><b>Subproblem 1:</b> is there an upper bound which is <i>p<sup>m<sup>c</sup></sup></i> for some <i>c</i>?
</p>
<p>
We were able to find the exact order of the smallest abelian group containing every abelian group of order <i>p<sup>m</sup></i>; it is <i>p</i><sup><i>F</i>(<i>m</i>)</sup>, where 
</p>
<p align="center">
<i>F</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Sigma;&lfloor;<i>m</i>/<i>k</i>&rfloor;,
</p>
<p>
where the sum over <i>k</i> runs from 1 to <i>m</i>. Dirichlet found the order of magnitude of this function; it is roughly <i>m</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>m</i>.
</p>
<p><b>Subproblem 2:</b> Is it true that no smaller non-abelian group can contain all abelian groups of order <i>p<sup>m</sup></i>?
</p>

<p><b>Problem 27: Directed and undirected Engel graph</b></p>
<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a group. For <i>x,y</i> in <i>G</i> and a natural number <i>n</i>, we define [<i>x,&nbsp;<sub>n</sub>y</i>] inductively by
<ul>
<li> [<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<sub>1</sub><i>y</i>]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[<i>x,&nbsp;y</i>]&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>x</i><sup>&minus;1</sup><i>y</i><sup>&minus;1</sup><i>xy</i>, </li>
<li> [<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<sub><i>n</i>+1</sub><i>y</i>]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[<i>x,&nbsp;<sub>n</sub>y</i>],&nbsp;<i>y</i>]. </li>
</ul>
The <em>directed Engel graph</em> on <i>G</i> is the graph with vertex set <i>G</i>, with an arc <i>y</i>&rarr;<i>x</i> if [<i>x,&nbsp;<sub>n</sub>y</i>] is
 the identity for some natural number <i>n</i>.
</p>
<p>
The graph has a loop at each vertex; these loops will not affect what follows.
</p>
<p>
If <i>G</i> is nilpotent, then any pair of vertices are joined by arcs in both directions, so we have the complete directed graph with loops. It follows
 from the theorem of Zorn that the converse of this is also true.
</p>
<p>
The <em>undirected Engel graph</em> is obtained by ignoring directions and loops and replacing a double edge by a single edge.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem 1:</b> Does the undirected Engel graph determine the directed Engel graph up to isomorphism? If this is false in general, for which groups does it hold?
</p>
<p>
Note that the analogous statement holds for the directed and undirected power graph.
</p>
<p>
In a recent preprint with Rishabh Chakraborty, Rajat Kanti Nath and Deiborlang Nongsiang (arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03879">2408.03879</a>),
 we showed (among other things) that, if <i>G</i> is a finite soluble group which is not nilpotent, then the directed Engel graph has two vertices joined
 by a single (non-loop) arc. These vertices can be chosen so that the source of the arc is in the Fitting subgroup of <i>G</i> (which is the set of vertices 
 which send arcs to all vertices) and the target is outside the Fitting subgroup.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem 2:</b> Classify the finite soluble groups for which all single arcs in the directed Engel graph have one vertex in the Fitting subgroup.

<p><b>Problem 28: Parker vector of generalised wreath product</b></p>
<p>
Richard Parker, who died recently, made a beautiful observation about finite permutation groups. 
He showed that the number <i>P<sub>k</sub></i> of orbits of a permutation group <i>G</i> on the set of
<i>k</i>-cycles of elements of the symmetric group which actually occur in elements of <i>G</i> is the
average, over <i>G</i>, of the number of points lying in <i>k</i>-cycles of an element of <i>G</i>.
As a consequence, this result generalises the Orbit-Counting Lemma, and also shows that the sum over <i>k</i>
of the numbers <i>P<sub>k</sub></i> is equal to the degree of the permutation group.
The tuple (<i>P</i><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<i>P<sub>n</sub></i>) is called the <em>Parker vector</em> of <i>G</i>.
</p>
<p>
Julian Gilbey showed me some time ago that the Parker vectors of the two wreath products
<i>G</i>&nbsp;wr&nbsp;<i>H</i> and <i>H</i>&nbsp;wr&nbsp;<i>G</i> are equal. This led me to wonder briefly
whether the Parker vector of a generalised wreath product depends only on the factors and not on the partially
ordered set used to glue them together. But this is false in general. The Parker vector of
<i>C</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;wr&nbsp;<i>C</i><sub>2</sub> is (1,2,0,1), whereas the Parker vector of
<i>C</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>C</i><sub>2</sub> is (1,3,0,0).
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Is it true that, if the factors of a generalized wreath product have pairwise coprime orders,
then the Parker vector is independent of the poset used in the construction but depends only on the factors?
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Problem 29: Is integrability decidable?</b>
</p>
 <p>
A beautiful theorem of Bettina Eick shows that a finite group <i>G</i> is
isomorphic to the Frattini subgroup of a finite group if and only if its inner
automorphism group is contained in the Frattini subgroup of its automorphism
group.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following question: Given a finite group <i>G</i>, is it
isomorphic to the derived group of a finite group? Embarrassingly, we don't
know if this question is even decidable!
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Show that the above question is decidable and give an algorithm
to decide it.
