<h2>2018 Summer Research problems in Algebra and Combinatorics</h2>
<p>
This page lists some collections of problems possibly of interest to summer
research students in Algebra and Combinatorics, together with relevant links.
</p>
<p>
The main document <a href="problems.pdf">problems.pdf</a> is a list compiled
for this year's Summer Research students. It contains problems about graphs
and groups, number theory, and combinatorics, and ends with a mixed bag of
miscellanea. Please take a copy and see if there is something there that
interests you.
</p>
A further document <a href="model.pdf">model.pdf</a> describes some problems
on the borders of combinatorics, group theory and logic (this is not complete
yet!)
</p>
<p>
The document <a href="hc.pdf">hc.pdf</a> contains a specific question about
acyclic orientations of graphs, the "Hanging Curtains conjecture".
</p>
<p>
I have put a copy of the paper from 2 years ago on the power graphs of
torsion-free groups <a href="327.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Further contributions (and solutions) welcome!
</p>
<p>
Please contact me if you want further information about the background to these
problems.
