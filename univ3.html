Here is a universality problem for graphs defined on groups. 
</p>
The <em>power graph</em> of a group <i>G</i> has an edge {<i>x,y</i>} if one of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is a power of the other; the <em>enhanced power graph</em>
 has an edge {<i>x,y</i>} if both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are powers of an element <i>z</i> (in other words, the group generated by <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is cyclic.
</p>
<p>
It is known that the power graph is the comparability graph of a partial order (and power graphs are universal for this class: that is, for any partial order, the comparability graph is embeddable as induced subgraph in the power graph of some group). Moreover, enhanced power graphs of groups form a universal class: every finite graph can be embedded as induced subgraph in the enhanced power graph of some group.
</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Suppose we are given a colouring of the edges of a finite complete graph with three colours, red, green, and blue. Under what conditions is it the case that the vertices can be embedded in a finite group in such a way that red edges belong to the power graph, green edges to the enhanced power graph but not the power graph, and blue edges to neither?
</p>
<p>
Some conditions are necessary. The red edges must form the comparability graph of a partial order; and if {<i>x,y</i>} is green then there must exist <i>z</i> such that {<i>x,z</i>} and {<i>y,z</i>} are red. Are these two conditions sufficient?
