<h4> Power graphs (update) </h4>
<p>
There are various classes of graphs which are recognised by a small list of
forbidden induced subgraphs, and which have nice algorithmic properties and
various applications; these include perfect graphs, cographs, chordal graphs,
split graphs, and threshold graphs. With Pallabi Manna and Ranjit Mehatari,
I have investigated when the power graph of a group belongs to one of these
classes. Power graphs are always perfect; we have found all groups for which
they are either split or threshold, and all nilpotent groups for which they
are either cographs or chordal. In addition, there is a long survey article
on power graphs. One curious fact proved here is that, if <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) is
the clique number of the power graph of a cyclic group of order <i>n</i>, then
&phi;(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>c</i>&phi;(<i>n</i>), where &phi; is Euler's totient function and <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.6481017597&hellip;.

<h4> Automorphisms of shift spaces </h4>
<p>
In two papers with Collin Bleak and Shayo Olukoya, I have looked further at
the connection between strongly synchronizing automata and transducers,
the Higman&ndash;Thompson finitely presented infinite simple groups, and
the automorphism group of the one- or two-sided shift.
