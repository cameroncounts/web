<p>
We are looking at writing a grant which combines forces between mathematicians and computer scientists some more. In the past mathematicians have come to us with interesting problems to be modelled and we have helped out. In the process of this we have found that there are many hidden mechanisms that we are not utilising to their fullest (or do not exist).

<p>
This talk will cover our experiences and explain what we are looking for. We want to create a discussion that will hopefully lead to an innovative (and successful) grant application.
