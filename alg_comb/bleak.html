</p>
<p>
 The subgroup structure of the R. Thompson groups <i>F</i>, <i>T</i>, and <i>V</i> have come under serious scrutiny lately due to to some groundbreaking results in C*-algebras, arising initially from work of Haagerup and Olesen on the amenability of <i>F</i>.   Their work opened a door, and peoples' interest immediately led (by further transformative work of Kalantar and Kennedy, Adrienne Le Boudec, Nicolas Matte-Bon, and others) to a complete transformation of our understanding of C*-simplicity.  One key and surprising result here: Matte Bon and Le Boudec provide examples of finitely presented C*-simple groups without free subgroups.

<p>
In any case, the work above leads to many interesting questions around the subgroup structures of <i>F</i>, <i>T</i>, and <i>V</i>.  In this talk, we give a report on our (with Jim Belk, Martyn Quick, and Rachel Skipper) current work towards classifying the maximal subgroups of <i>V</i>.
