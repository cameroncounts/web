Given a group <i>G</i>, we can construct associated graphs that encode certain relations between the elements of <i>G</i>. A well-known example is the <i>generating graph</i> of <i>G</i>, whose vertices are the nontrivial elements of G, with two vertices joined if the elements form a generating set for <i>G</i>. Breuer, Guralnick and Kantor showed in 2008 that if <i>G</i> is a finite non-abelian simple group, then this graph is connected with diameter 2.

We explore, for various families of finite groups, the connectedness and diameter of a related graph, obtained by taking the complement of the generating graph and then removing edges between elements that commute. In many cases, this is achieved by studying the maximal subgroup structures of the relevant groups.
