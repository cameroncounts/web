</p>
<p>
A permutation group <i>G</i> on an infinite set &Omega; is <i>oligomorphic</i> if the number <i>f<sub>n</sub></i>(<i>G</i>) of <i>G</i>-orbits in its induced action on the <i>n</i>-element subsets of &Omega; is finite for all positive integers <i>n</i>.
</p>
<p>
Oligomorphic groups are essentially the same as automorphism groups of countably categorical first-order structures.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s I started investigating these, and found what appeared to be a detailed structure of gaps in the growth rates. Apart from some very nice results by Dugald Macpherson, not much was done until very recently. But in the last year or two, many of my conjectures have been proved by Justine Falque, Nicolas Thi√©ry, Pierre Simon and Samuel Braunfeld. The techniques were algebraic (Cohen--Macauley algebras) and model-theoretic (monadic stability).
</p>
I will describe the growth rate structure with many examples, and if time permits, say something about the proofs.
