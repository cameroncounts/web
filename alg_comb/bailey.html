</p>
<p>
Group theory is used in (at least) two different ways in the design of experiments.  The first is in randomization, the process by which an initial design is turned into the actual layout for the experiment by applying a permutation of the experimental units, chosen at random from a certain group of permutations.  Which group? What properties should it have?  The second is in design construction.  The set of treatments is identified with a finite Abelian group, and the blocks are all translates of one or more initial blocks.  The characters of this group form its dual group: they are the eigenvectors of the matrix that we need to consider to see how good the proposed design is.
