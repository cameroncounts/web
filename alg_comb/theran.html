In the 1930s, Sch&ouml;nberg and Young--Householder classified when <i>n</i>(<i>n</i>&minus;1)/2 numbers <i>m<sub>ij</sub></i> are the pairwise distances among <i>n</i> points <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <i>p<sub>n</sub></i> in a Euclidean space and showed how to find the points from the distances.  This question of finding the points becomes more difficult when you take away the association between the <i>m<sub>ij</sub></i> and the points <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, but it was solved by Boutin and Kemper in the mid 2000s.  I'll talk about some generalisations of Boutin and Kemper's results obtained jointly with Shlomo Gortler and Dylan Thurston and Ioannis Gkioulekas, Shlomo Gortler, and Todd Zickler.
