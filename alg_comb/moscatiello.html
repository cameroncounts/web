<font size="+2">Maria Moscatiello, <i>On a bound of the number of maximal systems of imprimitivity of a finite transitive permutation group</i></font>
</p>
<p>
We will introduce some standard definitions in the context of transitive permutation groups and we will give a very gentle introduction to the concept of crowns of a finite group.
</p>
<p>
Using these bits of knowledge we will sketch how to prove that there exists a constant <i>a</i> such that a transitive permutation group of degree <i>n</i> has at most <i>an</i><sup>3/2</sup> maximal systems of imprimitivity.
</p>
<p>
When <i>G</i> is soluble, generalizing a classic result of Tim Wall, we will see that a much stronger bound holds, that is,  a soluble transitive permutation group of degree <i>n</i>&ge;2 has at most <i>n</i>&minus;1 maximal systems of imprimitivity.
