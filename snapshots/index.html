<h4>The existential transversal property</h4>
<p>
The permutation group <i>G</i> has the <i>k</i>-<em>existential transversal
property</em>, or <i>k</i>-et for short, if there is a <i>k</i>-subset
<i>A</i> of the domain (the <em>witnessing set</em>) such that, for any
<i>k</i>-partition <i>P</i> of the domain, there exists <i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i>
such that <i>Ag</i> is a transversal to <i>P</i>. With Jo&atilde;o Ara&#250;jo
and Wolfram Bentz, I determined all the finite permutation groups of degree
<i>n</i> with the <i>k</i>-et property for
4&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>k</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>n</i>/2, apart from a few
exceptional cases with <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 or <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.
There are applications to regular semigroups. See

<h4>Sylvester designs</h4>
<p>
The Sylvester graph is a remarkable distance-transitive graph of valency 5 on
36 vertices, which can be constructed using the even more remarkable outer
automorphism of the symmetric group <i>S</i><sub>6</sub>, as shown by Sylvester
(and described in Chapter 6 of my book with Jack van Lint). Now there is no
affine plane of order 6; but, with Rosemary Bailey, Leonard Soicher and Emlyn
Williams, I have been investigating block designs for which there is a Sylvester
graph on the set of treatments, and the concurrences are 2 for edges of the
graph and 1 for all other pairs. They, and designs obtained by deleting
resolution classes, are good substitutes for the missing lattice designs.
There seem to be many such designs; but just one admits all the symmetries of
the Sylvester graph. See

<h4>Commuting graph, power graph, etc.</h4>
<p>
There are various graphs defined on the set of elements of a group, such as
<ul>
<li> the <em>commuting graph</em>: two elements joined if they commute; </li>
<li> the <em>power graph</em>, two elements joined if one is a power of the other, and the <em>enhanced power graph</em>, two elements joined if both are powers of a common element; </li>
<li> the <em>non-generating graph</em>, two elements joined if they don't generate the group.
</ul>
For any group, the power graph is a subgraph of the enhanced power graph, which is a subgraph of the commuting graph; and, if the group is non-abelian and 2-generated, the commuting graph is a subgraph of the non-generating graph.
</p>
<p>
There are many questions about this sequence of graphs: for example, when are consecutive graphs equal? connectedness, clique number, independence number, chromatic number, and so on. One interesting observation is that a random walk on the commuting graph has limiting distribution which is uniform on <em>conjugacy classes</em>: what about random walks on the other graphs?

<h4>Diagonal groups</h4>
<p>
Diagonal groups are one class of primitive permutation groups arising in the
O'Nan&ndash;Scott theorem, and are slightly mysterious. With Rosemary Bailey,
Cheryl Praeger and Csaba Schneider, I am working on understanding these groups
better. As spin-offs, I have shown (with John Bray, Qi Cai, Pablo Spiga and
 Hua Zhang), using the Hall&ndash;Paige conjecture, that diagonal groups with
at least three simple factors in the socle are non-synchronizing, and
(with Sean Eberhard) that they preserve non-trivial association schemes.

<h4>Integrable groups</h4>
<p>
With Jo&atilde;o Ara&#250;jo, Carlo Casolo and Francesco Matucci, I determined
the set of natural numbers <i>n</i> with the property that every group of order
<i>n</i> is the derived subgroup of some group. This set is closely related to
(but slightly larger than) the set of <i>n</i> for which every group of order
<i>n</i> is abelian. We also showed that if a finite group is a derived group,
then it is the derived group of a finite group.

<h4>Equitable partitions of Latin square graphs</h4>
<p>
With Rosemary Bailey, Alexander Gavrilyuk, and Sergey Goryainov, I determined
the <em>equitable partitions</em> of Latin square graphs under an extra
assumption on eigenvalues. A partition is equitable if, given any two parts,
the number of neighbours in the second part of a vertex in the first depends
only on the parts and not on the chosen vertex.

<h4>Power graphs of torsion-free groups</h4>
<p>
In the directed power graph of a group, there is an arc from <i>x</i> to
<i>y</i> if <i>y</i> is a power of <i>x</i>; for the undirected power graph,
just ignore directions. The power graph does not in general determine the
directed power graph, even up to isomorphism (though it does for finite groups).
With Horacio Guerra and &#352;imon Jurina, I showed that for various
torsion-free groups, the directions are indeed determined.

<h4> Diagonal groups (update) </h4>
<p>
Diagonal groups <i>D</i>(<i>G,m</i>) for <i>G</i> a finite simple group are
one of the classes arising in the O'Nan--Scott Theorem. However, they can be
defined for any group <i>G</i>, not necessarily finite or simple. With Rosemary
Bailey, Cheryl Praeger and Csaba Schneider, I have defined for each pair
<i>G,m</i> where <i>G</i> is a group and <i>m</i> a dimension greater than 1,
a geometric structure called a <em>diagonal semilattice</em> whose automorphism
group is the corresponding diagonal group. We also gave simple axioms for these
geometries. For <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, a structure satisfying the axioms is
precisely a Latin square, but for <i>m</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2 the group <i>G</i>
arises naturally from the combinatorial axioms.
</p>
<p>
These structures consist of <i>m</i>+1 partitions of a set, any <i>m</i> of
which are the least elements in a <em>Cartesian lattice</em>.  With Rosemary,
Cheryl, and Michael Kinyon, I have looked at larger sets of partitions
satisfying these conditions, and found connections with orthogonal arrays,
arcs in projective space, and MDS codes.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the paper with Sean Eberhard contains a mistake which we have been
unable to fix.

<h4> Power graphs (update) </h4>
<p>
There are various classes of graphs which are recognised by a small list of
forbidden induced subgraphs, and which have nice algorithmic properties and
various applications; these include perfect graphs, cographs, chordal graphs,
split graphs, and threshold graphs. With Pallabi Manna and Ranjit Mehatari,
I have investigated when the power graph of a group belongs to one of these
classes. Power graphs are always perfect; we have found all groups for which
they are either split or threshold, and all nilpotent groups for which they
are either cographs or chordal. In addition, there is a long survey article
on power graphs. One curious fact proved here is that, if <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) is
the clique number of the power graph of a cyclic group of order <i>n</i>, then
&phi;(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>c</i>&phi;(<i>n</i>), where &phi; is Euler's totient function and <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.6481017597&hellip;.
</p>
<p>
A new update: Veronica Phan and I showed that the chromatic number of the
enhanced power graph is equal to its clique number, and is equal to the maximum
order of an element of the group.

<h4> Graphs on algebraic structures </h4>
<p>
At present I have a number of ongoing research projects on graphs defined on algebraic structures, mostly with colleagues in India.
</p>
<p><b>For which groups is the power graph a cograph?</b> The <em>power graph</em> of a group <i>G</i> has vertex set <i>G</i> and an edge from <i>x</i>
 to <i>y</i> if one is a power of the other. A <em>cograph</em>  is a graph with no induced 4-vertex path. This question generalises the classification
 of groups in which every element has prime power order, first posed by Graham Higman in the 1950s. With Pallabi Manna and Ranjit Mehatari, I have made
 some progress on this. The class of groups in question is subgroup-closed; we have determined the nilpotent groups and the simple groups in the class,
 and have a partial description of the soluble groups.
</p>
<p><b>Super graphs</b> For various classes of graphs defined on groups, and various natural partitions on groups, such as "conjugacy" or "same order",
 one can define a graph in which <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are joined if some elements in their equivalence classes are joined in the original graph. We
 (G. Arunkumar, Rajat Kanti Nath and Lavanya Selvaganesh) call these names on the pattern "conjugacy superpower graphs". Among a variety of results,
 we have shown that the conjugacy supercommuting graph coincides with the commuting graph if and only if the group is 2-<em>Engel</em>, that is, 
 satisfies the identity [[<i>y</i>,<i>x</i>],<i>x</i>]&nbsp;=&nbsp;1; while the groups for which the conjugacy superpower graph is equal to the power 
 graph are just the <em>Dedekind groups</em> (those with all subgroups normal).
</p>
<p><b>Commuting graphs</b> Which pairs of groups have isomorphic commuting graphs? With Vikraman Arvind, I have examined this question. If two groups 
 of the same order are <em>isoclinic</em>, then their commuting graphs are isomorphic. The converse is false, but we think it may be true for nilpotent 
 groups of class&nbsp;2; we can prove this in some cases.
</p>
<p><b>Universality of zero divisor graphs of rings</b> Rings here are finite commutative with identity; the zero divisor graph has vertices the zero 
 divisors, two vertices joined if their product is 0. We (G. Arunkumar, T. Tamizh Chelvam abd T. Kavaskar) have shown that, for various classes of 
 rings, the zero divisor graphs are <em>universal</em>, that is, contain every finite graph as an induced subgraph. There are some interesting classes 
 where this is not true, for example, local rings whose maximal ideal is principal: the zero divisor graph is a threshold graph (and is universal for 
 such graphs).
</p>
<p><b>Other work</b> I already mentioned the work with Swathi V. V. and M. S. Sunita on matchings: one of our striking results is that the matching 
 numbers of the power graph and enhanced power graph of a finite group are equal, even though we cannot say what the value is in all cases. Also, with 
 R. Raveendra Prathap and T. Tamizh Chelvam, we have generalised the prime sum graph of a finite abelian group to the "subgroup sum graph", and 
 investigated its properties.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Low in the permutation group hierarchy</h4>
<p>
With Marina Anagnostopoulou-Merkouri and Enoch Suleiman, I defined a concept for finite permutation groups lying between transitivity and primitivity,
which we called "pre-primitivity". It has the property that it is logically independent of quasiprimitivity, but together with quasiprimitivity it is 
equivalent to primitivity. So it throws some light on the gap (which confused Galois, who devised both concepts) between quasiprimitivity and 
primitivity. We proved various things about pre-primitivity. The paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13703">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
In subsequent work with Marina, I have defined an even weaker concept, which we don't have a name for yet, tentatively the OBS property. The term comes 
from experimental design in statistics, where an orthogonal block structure is a set of partitions of a finite set which forms a lattice (with top element
the partition with a single part and bottom element the partition into singletons), such that any partition in the set is uniform, and any two commute
(as relations). A transitive permutation group has the OBS property if the partitions invariant under the group form an orthogonal block structure. This
 property lies between transitivity and pre-primitivity, and almost all transitive groups appear to satisfy it. This is still under investigation.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Bases</h4>
 <p>
A <em>base</em> for a permutation group is a sequence (<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<i>a<sub>r</sub></i>) of points in the permutation domain whose pointwise stabiliser is the identity.
 A base is <em>irredundant</em> if no point in the base is fixed by the stabiliser of its predecessors; it is <em>minimal</em> if no point in the base is fixed by the stabiliser of all the others.
</p>
<p>
A couple of things are clear:
<ul>
<li> any minimal base is irredundant (but the converse is false); </li>
<li> any re-ordering of a minimal base is minimal (but this is not true for
irredundant bases). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In 1995, Dima Fon-Der-Flaass and I showed that the three conditions on irredundant bases, namely
<ul>
<li> they are preserved by re-ordering;
<li> they all have the same size;
<li> they are the bases of a matroid;
</ul>
are all equivalent. We call groups having this property <em>IBIS groups</em>.
</p>
<p>
Recently several people (Murray Whyte, Scott Harper, Pablo Spiga, maybe others) asked whether the set of sizes of irredundant bases form an interval. This is true. However,
the analogue for minimal bases is false. For any integer <i>d</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1, there is a group whose minimal bases have sizes 1 and d only. However, it is not yet known whether
they do form an interval if the permutation group is required to be transitive.
</p>
<p>
A further question is: What happens for greedy bases? One of these is found by choosing the next base point in an orbit of maximum size for the stabiliser of its predecessors.
 (There is some variability because there might be a number of orbits of the same size.)
</p>
<hr>
 <h4>Cauchy numbers</h4>
<p>
In group theory, <em>Cauchy's Theorem</em> states that, if a prime <i>p</i> divides the order of a finite group <i>G</i>, then <i>G</i> contains a subgroup which is cyclic of order <i>p</i>.
</p>
<p>
Can we reverse-engineer this? Clearly we cannot ask for a single subgroup, since primes are the only numbers for which such a result would be true. So we say that <i>n</i> is a <em>Cauchy number</em> if there is a finite list <b>F</b> of finite groups such that a finite group <i>G</i> has order divisible by <i>n</i> if and only if <i>G</i> has a subgroup isomorphic to one of the groups in <b>F</b>.
</p>
In a paper with David Craven, Hamid Reza Dorbidi, Scott Harper and Benjamin Sambale, I proved that the Cauchy numbers are as follows:
<ul>
<li> prime powers; </li>
<li> 6; </li>
<li> 2<i>p<sup>a</sup></i>, where <i>p</i> is a Fermat prime greater than 3 and <i>a</i> is a positive integer. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For example, the list for <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 consists of three groups: the cyclic and dihedral groups of order 6 and the alternating group A<sub>4</sub> of order 12.
</p>
<p>
The paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15652">here</a>.
</p>
<hr>
 <h4>Generalised wreath products</h4>
<p>
Let <i>M</i> be a set carrying a partial order, and (<i>G</i>(<i>m</i>)) be a family of transitive permutation groups indexed by <i>M</i>. 
 The <em>generalised wreath product</em> of the family over the poset is a construction of a permutation group on the cartesian product
 of the domains; it is too complicated to define here, but note that the g.w.p. over a 2-element antichain is the direct product,
 while the g.w.p. over a 2-element chain is the wreath product.
</p>
<p>
In a joint paper with Marina Anagnostopoulou-Merkouri and Rosemary Bailey, we prove a number of results. Two of them are:
<ul>
<li> a generalisation of the Krasner&ndash;Kaloujnine theorem: a transitive group which leaves invariant a distributive lattice
 of commuting equivalence relations is embeddable in a generalised wreath product of groups which can be extracted from the given action; </li>
<li> the generalised wreath product over an arbitrary poset is the intersection of the iterated wreath products of the same groups
 over all linear extensions of the poset. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
 <h4>The Frobenius&ndash;Wielandt theorem</h4>
<p>
The famous theorem of Frobenius can be stated in two different-looking ways:
<ul>
<li> In a transitive (but not regular) finite permutation group in which the 
non-identity elements fix at most two points, the identity and fixed-point-free
elements form a normal subgroup. </li>
<li> If the finite group <i>G</i> has a non-trivial proper subgroup <i>H</i>
such that the intersection of <i>H</i> and <i>g</i><sup>&minus;1</sup><i>Hg</i>
is trivial for any element <i>g</i> not in <i>H</i>, then the identity and the
set of elements not in conjugates of <i>H</i> form a normal subgroup. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This led to two rather different extensions of the theorem. On the permutation
group side, Zantema (in connection with a number theory problem) examined the
fixed-point-free elements in an arbitrary transitive group, and this was taken
further by Bailey, Giudici, Royle and me who posed the following problem. If
<i>D</i>(<i>G</i>) is the subgroup generated by fixed-point-free elements, what
can the "derangement quotient" <i>G</i>/<i>D</i>(<i>G</i>) be? Clearly any
Frobenius complement can occur, but we found some other examples.
</p>
<p>
On the abstract group side, Wielandt generalised Frobenius' theorem to a class of groups
now called Frobenius&ndash;Wielandt groups, and Scoppola examined which
groups of prime power order could occur as "Frobenius&ndash;Wielandt complements".
</p>
<p>
We have now joined forces and shown that the two approaches are more-or-less
equivalent; each throws more light on the other, and in particular, Scoppola's
results give further examples of derangement quotients.
</p>
<p>
The paper by Bailey, Gavioli, Scoppola and me is
