 <p>
As a contribution to the study of graphs on groups, we show that the commuting
graph of a finite group <i>G</i> is a split graph, or a threshold graph, if and only
if either <i>G</i> is abelian or <i>G</i> is a generalized dihedral group
  <blockquote>
D(<i>A</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;<i>A,t</i>&nbsp;:&nbsp;(for all <i>a</i>&isin;<i>A</i>)(<i>at</i>)<sup>2</sup>=1&rang;
  </blockquote>
   where <i>A</i> is an abelian group of odd order.

Minimum degrees of finite rectangular bands, null semigroups,
and variants of full transformation semigroups</a>,
 <em>Combinatorial Theory</em> <b>3(3)</b> (2023), #16 (48pp.)
 </p>
 <p>
 For a positive integer <i>n</i>, the full transformation semigroup <i>T<sub>n</sub></i>
consists of all self maps of the set {1,&hellip;,<i>n</i>} under composition. Any finite
semigroup <i>S</i> embeds in some <i>T<sub>n</sub></i>, and
the least such <i>n</i> is called the (minimum transformation) degree of <i>S</i> and
denoted &mu;(<i>S</i>). We find degrees for various classes of finite semigroups,
including rectangular bands, rectangular groups and null semigroups. The formulae we
give involve natural parameters associated to integer compositions. Our results on
rectangular bands answers a question of Easdown from 1992, and our approach utilises
some results of independent interest concerning partitions/colourings of hypergraphs.
 </p>
 <p>
As an application, we prove some results on the degree of a variant
<i>T<sub>n</sub><sup>a</sup></i>. (The variant <i>S<sup>a</sup></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>S</i>,*)
of a semigroup <i>S</i> with respect to a fixed element <i>a</i>&isin;<i>S</i>, has
underlying set <i>S</i> and operation <i>x</i>*<i>y</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>xay</i>.) It has
been previously shown that
<i>n</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&mu;(<i>T<sub>n</sub><sup>a</sup></i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;2<i>n</i>&minus;<i>r</i>
if the sandwich element <i>a</i> has rank <i>r</i>, and the upper bound of 2<i>n</i>&minus;<i>r</i>
is known to be sharp if <i>r</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;<i>n</i>&minus;1. Here we show that
&mu;(<i>T<sub>n</sub><sup>a</sup></i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<i>n</i>&minus;<i>r</i> for
<i>r</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;<i>n</i>&minus;6. In stark contrast to this, when
<i>r</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and the above inequality says
<i>n</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&mu;(<i>T<sub>n</sub><sup>a</sup></i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;2<i>n</i>&minus;1, 
  we show that &mu;(<i>T<sub>n</sub><sup>a</sup></i>)/<i>n</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;1 and
&mu;(<i>T<sub>n</sub><sup>a</sup></i>)&minus;<i>n</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&infin; as
<i>n</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&infin;.
</p>
<p>
Among other results, we also classify the 3-nilpotent subsemigroups of
 <i>T<sub>n</sub></i>, and calculate
the maximum size of such a subsemigroup.

  Generalized non-coprime graph of groups,</a>
  <em>J. Algebraic Combinatorics</em>, in press
 </p>
 <p>
Let <i>G</i>  be a finite group with identity <i>e</i> and <i>H</i> be a non-trivial
  subgroup of <i>G</i>. The generalized non-coprime graph &Gamma;(<i>G,H</i>) of  <i>G</i>
  with respect to <i>H</i> is the simple undirected graph with <i>G</i>&minus;<i>e</i> as
  the vertex set and two distinct vertices <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are adjacent if and only
  if gcd(|<i>x</i>|,|<i>y</i>|)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1 and either <i>x</i>&isin;<i>H</i>  or
  <i>y</i>&isin;<i>H</i>, where |<i>x</i>| is the order of <i>x</i>&isin;<i>G</i>.
  In this paper, we study certain graph theoretical properties of generalized non-coprime
  graphs of finite groups, concentrating on cyclic groups. More specifically, we obtain
  necessary and sufficient conditions for the generalized non-coprime graph of a cyclic
  group to be in the class of stars, paths, triangle-free, complete bipartite,
  complete, split, claw-free, chordal or perfect graphs. Then we show that widening
  the class of groups to all finite nilpotent groups gives us no new graphs, but we
  give as an example of contrasting behaviour the class of EPPO groups (those in which
  all elements have prime power order). We conclude with a connection to the Gruenberg&ndash;Kegel
  graph.

   What can graphs and algebraic structures say to each other?
   <em>AKCE Internat. J. Graphs and Combinatorics</em>, in press
 </p>
<p>
 In the last couple of decades, there has been a big upsurge of research on
graphs defined on algebraic structures (groups, rings, vector spaces,
semigroups, and others). Much of this has concerned detailed 
graph-theoretic properties and parameters of these graphs. However, my concern
here is to consider how this research can benefit both graph theory and
algebra. I am mainly concerned with graphs on groups, and will give three types
of interaction between graphs and groups, with examples of each taken from
recent research. The paper also contains a number of open questions.
</p>
<p> 
This talk was presented at the conference ICRAGAA 2023 held in Thrissur in
Kerala, India. I am grateful to the organisers of the conference, and also
to Ambat Vijayakumar and Aparna Lakshmanan S, who organised a very productive
on-line research discussion on graphs and groups in 2021. Much of what I report
has its roots in that discussion. I am grateful to them for organising this
discussion, as well as to the conference organisers, and all my many co-authors.

   Pre-primitive permutation groups</a>, <em>J. Algebra</em> <b>636</b> (2023), 695-715
 </p>
 <p>
  A transitive permutation group <i>G</i> on a finite set &Omega; is said to be
<em>pre-primitive</em> if every <i>G</i>-invariant partition of &Omega; is the
orbit partition of a subgroup of <i>G</i>. It follows that pre-primitivity and
quasiprimitivity are logically independent (there are groups satisfying
one but not the other) and their conjunction is equivalent to primitivity.
Indeed, part of the motivation for studying pre-primitivity is to investigate
the gap between primitivity and quasiprimitivity. We investigate the
pre-primitivity of various classes of transitive groups including groups with
regular normal subgroups, direct and wreath products, and diagonal groups.
In the course of this investigation, we describe all <i>G</i>-invariant partitions
for various classes of permutation groups <i>G</i>.
We also look briefly at conditions similarly related to other pairs of
conditions, including transitivity and quasiprimitivity, <i>k</i>-homogeneity and
<i>k</i>-transitivity, and primitivity and synchronization.

  Designs for half-diallel experiments with commutative orthogonal block structure,</a>
  <em>J. Statit. Planning Inference</em>  <b>231</b> (2024), 106139
</p>
<p>  In some experiments,
  the experimental units are all pairs of individuals who have
  to undertake a given task together.  The set of such pairs forms a
  triangular association scheme.  Appropriate randomization then gives two
  non-trivial strata.  The design is said to have commutative orthogonal
  block structure (COBS) if the best linear unbiased estimators of
  treatment contrasts do not depend on the stratum variances.  There are
precisely three ways in which such a design can have COBS.  We give a
  complete description of designs for which all treatment contrasts are in
  the same stratum.  Then we give a very general construction for designs
  with COBS which have some treatment contrasts in each stratum.

       A survey on varieties generated by small semigroups and a companion website,</a>
   <em>J. Algebra</em> <b>635</b> (2023), 698-735 
 </p>
 <p>
  The aim of this paper is to provide an atlas of identity bases for varieties generated by  small semigroups and groups.  
  To help the working mathematician easily find information, we provide a companion website that runs in the background
  automated reasoning tools, finite model builders, and GAP, so that the user has an automatic \textit{intelligent} guide on the literature.
 </p>
 <p>
This paper is mainly a survey of what is known about identity bases for semigroups or groups of small orders, and we also mend some gaps
  left unresolved by previous authors. For instance, we provide the first complete and justified list of identity bases for the
  varieties generated by a semigroup of order up to 4, and the companion website contains the list of varieties generated by a semigroup
  of order up to 5.

v^*-algebras, through Deza's geometric groups and Zilber's
homogeneous geometries, to Sims' bases for permutation groups
and their use in defining "size" parameters on finite groups, with a brief

Association schemes with given stratum dimensions: on a paper of
Peter M. Neumann</a>, <em>Algebraic
Combinatorics</em> <b>6</b> (2023), 1189-1210
</p>
<p>
In January 1969, Peter M. Neumann wrote a paper entitled "Primitive
permutation groups of degree 3<i>p</i>". The main theorem placed restrictions
on the parameters of a primitive but not 2-transitive permutation group
of degree three times a prime. The paper was never published, and the results
have been superseded by stronger theorems depending on the classification of
the finite simple groups, for example a classification of primitive groups of
odd degree.
<p>
</p>
However, there are further reasons for being interested in this paper. First,
it was written at a time when combinatorial techniques were being introduced
into the theory of finite permutation groups, and the paper gives a very
good summary and application of these techniques. Second, like its predecessor
by Helmut Wielandt on primitive groups of degree 2<i>p</i>, it can be
re-interpreted as a combinatorial result concerning association schemes whose
common eigenspaces have dimensions of a rather limited form. This result
uses neither the primality of <i>p</i> nor the existence of a permutation group
related to the combinatorial structure. We extract these results and give
details of the related combinatorics.

</p>
<p>
Eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a graph have been widely used in
studying connectivity and expansion properties of networks, and also in
analysing random walks on a graph.
</p>
<p>
Independently, statisticians introduced various optimality criteria in
experimental design,
the goal being to obtain more accurate estimates of quantities of interest in
an experiment.
It turns out that the most popular of these optimality criteria for block
designs are
determined by the Laplacian eigenvalues of the concurrence graph,
or of the Levi graph, of the design.
</p>
The most important optimality criteria, called A (average), D (determinant)
and E (extreme),
are related to the conductance of the graph as an electrical network,
the number of spanning
trees, and the isoperimetric properties of the graphs, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The number of spanning trees is also an evaluation of the Tutte polynomial
of the graph,
and is the subject of the Merino--Welsh conjecture relating it to acyclic
and totally cyclic
orientations, of interest in their own right.

Solvable conjugacy class graph of groups,</a>

<p>
In this paper we introduce the graph &Gamma;<sub>sc</sub>(<i>G</i>)$ associated with  a group <i>G</i>,
 called the solvable conjugacy class graph (abbreviated as SCC-graph), whose  vertices are the nontrivial
 conjugacy classes of <i>G</i> and two distinct  conjugacy classes <i>C, D</i> are adjacent if there exist
 <i>x</i>&isin;<i>C</i> and <i>y</i>&isin;<i>D</i> such that &lang;<i>x, y</i>&rang; is solvable.
</p>
<p>
We discuss the connectivity, girth, clique number, and several other properties of the SCC-graph. One of
 our results asserts that there are only finitely many finite groups whose SCC-graph has given clique
 number <i>d</i>, and we find explicitly the list of such groups with <i>d</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. We pose some
 problems on the relation of the SCC-graph to the solvabale graph and to the NCC-graph, which we cannot solve.

Induced subgraphs of zero-divisor graphs,</a>
<i>Discrete Math.</i> <b>346</b> (2023), paper 113580
</p>
<p>
The zero-divisor graph of a finite commutative ring with unity is the graph
whose vertex set is the set of zero-divisors in the ring, with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
adjacent if <i>ab</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. We show that the class of zero-divisor graphs is universal,
in the sense that every finite graph is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of
a zero-divisor graph. This remains true for various restricted classes of
rings, including boolean rings, products of fields, and local rings. But
in more restricted classes, the zero-divisor graphs do not form a universal
family. For example, the zero-divisor graph of a local ring whose maximal
ideal is principal is a threshold graph; and every threshold graph
is embeddable in the zero-divisor graph of such a ring.
More generally, we give necessary and
sufficient conditions on a non-local ring for which its zero-divisor graph to be a threshold
graph. In addition, we show that there is a countable local ring whose zero-divisor
graph embeds the Rado graph, and hence every finite or countable graph,
as induced subgraph. Finally, we consider embeddings in related graphs such as
the 2-dimensional dot product graph.

Let <i>G</i> be a finite abelian group, written additively, and <i>H</i> a
subgroup of <i>G</i>. The <em>subgroup sum graph
</em> &Gamma;<sub><i>G,H</i></sub> is the graph with vertex set <i>G</i>, in
which two distinct vertices <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are joined if

Cayley sum graphs. Among cases which have been considered previously are the
<em>prime sum graphs</em>, in the case where <i>H</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>pG</i>
for some prime number <i>p</i>. In this paper we present their structure and
a detailed analysis of their properties. We also consider the simpler graph
&Gamma;<sup>+</sup><sub><i>G,H</i></sub>, which we refer to as the
<em>extended subgroup sum graph</em>, in which <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are joined
if <i>x</i>+<i>y</i>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;<i>H</i>: the subgroup sum is obtained by removing from this graph the partial matching of edges having the form
{<i>x</i>,&minus;<i>x</i>} when 2<i>x</i>&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0. We study
perfectness, clique number and independence number, connectedness, diameter,
spectrum, and domination number of these graphs and their complements. We
interpret our general results in detail in the prime sum graphs.

Super graphs on groups, I. <em>Graphs and Combinatorics</em>, in press
</p>
<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a finite group. A number of graphs with the vertex set <i>G</i> have been studied, including the power graph, enhanced power graph, and commuting graph. These graphs form a hierarchy under the inclusion of edge sets, and it is useful to study them together. In addition, several authors have considered modifying the definition of these graphs by choosing a natural equivalence relation on the group such as equality, conjugacy, or equal orders, and joining two elements if there are elements in their equivalence class that are adjacent in the original graph. In this way, we enlarge the hierarchy into a second dimension. Using the three graph types and three equivalence relations mentioned gives nine graphs, of which in general only two coincide; we find conditions on the group for some other pairs to be equal. These often define interesting classes of groups, such as EPPO groups, 2-Engel groups, and Dedekind groups.
</p>
<p>
We study some properties of graphs in this new hierarchy. In particular, we characterize the groups for which the graphs are complete, and in most cases, we characterize the dominant vertices (those joined to all others). Also, we give some results about universality,  perfectness, and clique number.

The purpose of this note is to define a graph whose vertex set is a finite group <i>G</i>, whose edge set is contained in that of the commuting graph of <i>G</i> and contains the enhanced power graph of <i>G</i>. We call this graph the deep commuting graph of <i>G</i>. Two elements of <i>G</i> are joined in the deep commuting graph if and only if their inverse images in every central extension of <i>G</i> commute.

We give conditions for the graph to be equal to either of the enhanced power graph and the commuting graph, and show that the automorphism group of <i>G</i> acts as automorphisms of the deep commuting graph.

<p>
Block designs are useful in experimental design when the experimental material is not uniform but can be divided into homogeneous blocks. Typically, blocks cannot contain all the treatments, so incomplete block designs are used. The condition of balance, if it can be achieved, guarantees that the designs are optimal in
minimizing the variance of treatment differences.
</p>
<p>
This entry provides a survey of balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). It discusses necessary conditions on the parameters for the existence of the designs and optimality results. It also provides a brief introduction to constructions of BIBDs using difference families, finite fields, or recursive methods, and some generalizations, including pointers about what to do if no BIBD is available.

<i>Annals of Combinatorics</i> <b>26</b> (2022), 379-391.
</p>
<p>
The power graph P(<i>G</i>) of a finite group <i>G</i> is the undirected simple
graph with vertex set <i>G</i>, where two elements are adjacent if one is a
power of the other. In this paper, the matching numbers of power graphs of
finite groups are investigated. We give upper and lower bounds, and conditions
for the power graph of a group to possess a perfect matching. We give a formula
for the matching number for any finite nilpotent group. In addition, using some
elementary number theory, we show that the matching number of the enhanced
power graph P<sub>e</sub>(<i>G</i>) of <i>G</i> (in which two elements are
adjacent if both are powers of a common element) is equal to that of the power
graph of <i>G</i>.

Criterion of unrecognizability of a finite group by its Gruenberg--Kegel graph,
<em>J. Algebra</em> <b>607</b> (2022), 186-213 </a>
</p>
<p>
The Gruenberg--Kegel graph &Gamma;(<i>G</i>) associated with a finite group <i>G</i> is an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges whose vertices are the prime divisors of |<i>G</i>| and in which vertices <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are adjacent in &Gamma;(<i>G</i>)  if and only if <i>G</i> contains an element of order <i>pq</i>. This graph has been the subject of much recent interest; one of our goals here is to give a survey of some of this material, relating to groups with the same Gruenberg--Kegel graph. However, our main aim is to prove several new results. Among them are the following.
<ul>
<li> There are infinitely many finite groups with the same Gruenberg--Kegel graph as the Gruenberg--Kegel of a finite group <i>G</i> if and only if there is a finite group <i>H</i> with non-trivial solvable radical such that &Gamma;(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Gamma;(<i>H</i>). </li>
<li> There is a function <i>F</i> on the natural numbers with the property that if a finite <i>n</i>-vertex graph whose vertices are labelled by pairwise distinct primes is the Gruenberg--Kegel graph of more than <i>F</i>(<i>n</i>) finite groups, then it is the Gruenberg--Kegel graph of infinitely many finite groups. (The function we give satisfies <i>F</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>7</sup>), but this is not best possible.) </li>
<li> If a finite graph &Gamma; whose vertices are labelled by pairwise distinct primes is the Gruenberg--Kegel graph of only finitely many finite groups, then all such groups are almost simple; moreover, &Gamma; has at least three pairwise non-adjacent vertices, and each vertex is non-adjacent to at least one other vertex, in particular, 2 is non-adjacent to at least one odd vertex. </li>
<li> Groups whose power graphs, or commuting graphs, are isomorphic have the same Gruenberg--Kegel graph. </li>
<li> The groups <sup>2</sup><i>G</i><sub>2</sub>(27) and <i>E</i><sub>8</sub>(2) are uniquely determined by the isomorphism types of their Gruenberg--Kegel graphs. </li>
</ul>
In addition, we consider groups whose Gruenberg--Kegel graph has no edges. These are the groups in which every element has prime power order, and have been studied under the name <em>EPPO groups</em>; completing this line of research, we give a complete list of such groups.

</p>
<p>
A universal algebra <b>A</b> with underlying set <i>A</i> is said to be an independence algebra if it is a matroid algebra and every mapping &alpha;:<i>X</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>A</i> defined on a basis <i>X</i> of <b>A</b> can be extended to an endomorphism of <b>A</b>. These algebras are particularly well-behaved generalizations of vector spaces, and hence they naturally appear in several branches of mathematics, such as model theory, group theory, and semigroup theory.
</p>
<p>
It is well known that matroid algebras have a well-defined notion of dimension.  Let <b>A</b> be any independence algebra of finite dimension <i>n</i>, with at least two elements.  Denote by End(<b>A</b>) the monoid of endomorphisms of <b>A</b>. In the 1970s, G&#322;azek proposed the problem of extending the matrix theory for vector spaces to a class of universal algebras which included independence algebras. In this paper, we answer that problem by developing a theory of matrices for (almost all) finite-dimensional independence algebras.
</p>
<p>
In the process of solving this, we explain the relation between the classification of independence algebras obtained by Urbanik in the 1960s, and the classification of finite independence algebras up to endomorphism-equivalence obtained by Cameron and Szab&oacute; in 2000. (This answers another question by experts on independence algebras.)  We also extend the classification of Cameron and Szab&oacute; to all independence algebras.
</p>
<p>
The paper closes with a number of questions for experts on matrix theory, groups, semigroups, universal algebra, set theory or model theory.

On finite groups whose power graph is a cograph,</a>
<em>J. Algebra</em> <b>591</b> (2022), 59-74.
<p>
A <i>P</i><sub>4</sub>-free graph is called a cograph. In this paper we partially characterize finite groups whose power graph is a cograph. As we will see, this problem is a generalization of the determination of groups in which every element has prime power order, first raised by Graham Higman in 1957 and fully solved very recently.
</p>
<p>
First we determine all groups <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> for which the power graph of <i>G</i>&times;<i>H</i> is a cograph.  We show that groups whose power graph is a cograph can be characterised by a condition only involving elements whose orders are prime or the product of two (possibly equal) primes. Some important graph classes are also taken under consideration. For finite simple groups we show that in most of the cases their power graphs are not cographs: the only ones for which the power graphs are cographs are certain groups PSL(2,<i>q</i>) and Sz(<i>q</i>) and the group PSL(3,4). However, a complete determination of these groups involves some hard number-theoretic problems.

Algebraic graph theory is the study of the interplay between algebraic
structures (both abstract as well as linear structures) and graph theory.
Many concepts of abstract algebra have facilitated through the construction
of graphs which are used as tools in computer science. Conversely, graph
theory has also helped to characterize certain algebraic properties of
abstract algebraic structures. In this survey, we highlight the rich interplay
between the two topics viz groups and power graphs from groups. In the last
decade, extensive contribution has been made towards the investigation of
power graphs. Our main motive is to provide a complete survey on the
connectedness of power graphs and proper power graphs, the Laplacian and
adjacency spectrum of power graph, isomorphism, and automorphism of power
graphs, characterization of power graphs in terms of groups. Apart from the
survey of results, this paper also contains some new material such as the
contents of Section 2 (which describes the interesting case of the power graph
of the Mathieu group <i>M</i><sub>11</sub>) and subsection 6.1  (where
conditions are discussed for the reduced power graph to be not connected). We
conclude this paper by presenting a set of open problems and conjectures on
power graphs.

The geometry of diagonal groups,
<em>Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.</em> <b>375</b> (2022), 5259-5311.
</p>
<p>
Diagonal groups are one of the classes of finite primitive permutation groups
occurring in the conclusion of the O'Nan&ndash;Scott theorem. Several of the
other classes have been described as the automorphism groups of geometric
or combinatorial structures such as affine spaces or Cartesian decompositions,
but such structures for diagonal groups have not been studied in general.

The main purpose of this paper is to describe and characterise such
structures, which we call <em>diagonal semilattices</em>. Unlike the 
diagonal groups in the O'Nan&ndash;Scott theorem, which are defined over finite
characteristically simple groups, our construction works over arbitrary 
groups, finite or infinite.
</p>
<p>
A diagonal semilattice depends on a dimension <i>m</i> and a group <i>T</i>.
For <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, it is a Latin square, the Cayley table of <i>T</i>,
though in fact any Latin square satisfies our combinatorial axioms. However,
for <i>m</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3, the group <i>T</i> emerges naturally and
uniquely from the axioms. (The situation somewhat resembles projective 
geometry, where projective planes exist in great profusion but
higher-dimensional structures are coordinatised by an algebraic object, a
division ring.)
</p>
<p>
A diagonal semilattice is contained in the partition lattice on a
set &Omega;, and we provide an introduction to the calculus of partitions. Many
of the concepts and constructions come from experimental design in statistics.
</p>
<p>
We also determine when a diagonal group can be primitive, or quasiprimitive
(these conditions turn out to be equivalent for diagonal groups).
</p>
<p>
Associated with the diagonal semilattice is a graph, the diagonal graph,
which has the same automorphism group as the diagonal semilattice except
in four small cases with <i>m</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3. The class of diagonal
graphs includes some well-known families, Latin-square graphs and folded cubes,
and is potentially of interest. We obtain partial results on the chromatic
number of a diagonal graph, and mention an application to the synchronization
property of permutation groups.

Diagonal groups and arcs over groups,
<em>Designs, Codes, Cryptography</em> <b>90</b> (2022), 2069-2080,
</p>

<p>
In an earlier paper by three of the present authors and Csaba Schneider,
it was shown that, for <i>m</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2, a set of <i>m</i>+1 
partitions of a set &Omega;,
any <i>m</i> of which are the minimal non-trivial elements of a Cartesian
lattice,
either form a Latin square (if <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), or generate a
join-semilattice of dimension <i>m</i> associated with a diagonal group over a
base group <i>G</i>.
</p>
<p>
In this paper we investigate what happens if we have <i>m</i>+<i>r</i>
partitions with <i>r</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2, any <i>m</i> of which are minimal
elements of a Cartesian lattice. If <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, this is just a set
of mutually orthogonal Latin squares. We consider
the case where all these squares are isotopic to Cayley tables of groups, and
give an example to show the groups need not be all isomorphic. For 
<i>m</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2,
things are more restricted. Any <i>m</i>+1 of the partitions generate a
join-semilattice admitting a diagonal group over a group <i>G</i>. It may be
that the groups are all isomorphic, though we cannot prove this. Under an extra
hypothesis, we show that <i>G</i> must be abelian and must have three
fixed-point-free automorphisms whose product is the identity. (We describe
explicitly all abelian groups having such automorphisms.) Under this
hypothesis, the structure gives an orthogonal array, and conversely in some
cases.
</p>
<p>
If the group is cyclic of prime order <i>p</i>, then the structure corresponds
exactly to an arc of cardinality <i>m</i>+<i>r</i> in the
(<i>m</i>&minus;1)-dimensional projective
space over the field with <i>p</i> elements, so all known results about
arcs are applicable. More generally, arcs over a finite field of order $q$
give examples where <i>G</i> is the elementary abelian group of order <i>q</i>.
These examples can be lifted to non-elementary abelian groups using 
<i>p</i>-adic techniques.

The diagonal graph,
<em>J. Ramanujan Math. Soc.</em> <b>36</b> (2021), 353-361.
</p>
<p>
According to the O'Nan--Scott Theorem, a finite primitive permutation group
either preserves a structure of one of three types (affine space, Cartesian
lattice, or diagonal semilattice), or is almost simple. However, diagonal
groups are a much larger class than those occurring in this theorem. For any
positive integer <i>m</i> and group <i>G</i> (finite or infinite), there is a
diagonal semilattice, a sub-semilattice of the lattice of partitions of a set
&Omega;, whose automorphism group is the corresponding diagonal group.
Moreover, there is a graph (the diagonal graph), bearing much the same
relation to the diagonal semilattice and group as the Hamming graph does to
the Cartesian lattice and the wreath product of symmetric groups.
</p>
<p>
Our purpose here, after a brief introduction to this semilattice and graph, is
to establish some properties of this graph. The diagonal graph 
&Gamma;<sub>D</sub>(<i>G,m</i>) is a Cayley graph for the group
<i>G<sup>m</sup></i>, and so is vertex-transitive. We establish its clique
number in general and its chromatic number in most cases, with a conjecture
about the chromatic number in the remaining cases. We compute the spectrum of
the adjacency matrix of the graph, using a calculation of the M&ouml;bius
function of the diagonal semilattice. We also compute some other graph
parameters and symmetry properties of the graph.
</p>
<p>
We believe that this family of graphs will play a significant role in algebraic
graph theory.

Forbidden subgraphs of power graphs,

</p>
<p>
The undirected power graph (or simply power graph) of a group <i>G</i>, denoted
by <i>P</i>(<i>G</i>), is a graph whose vertices are the elements of the group
<i>G</i>, in which two vertices <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are connected by an edge
between if and only if either <i>u</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>v<sup>i</sup></i> or 
<i>v</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>u<sup>j</sup></i> for some <i>i,j</i>.
</p>
<p>
A number of important graph classes, including perfect graphs, cographs,
chordal graphs, split graphs, and threshold graphs, can be defined either
structurally or in terms
of forbidden induced subgraphs. We examine each of these five classes and
attempt to determine for which groups <i>G</i> the power graph
<i>P</i>(<i>G</i>) lies in the class under consideration. We give complete
results in the case of nilpotent groups, and partial results in greater
generality. In particular, the power graph is always perfect; and we determine
completely the groups whose power graph is a threshold or split graph (the
answer is the same for both classes). We give a number of open problems.

This paper concerns aspects of various graphs whose vertex set is a group
<i>G</i> and whose edges reflect group structure in some way (so that, in
particular, they are invariant under the action of the automorphism group of
<i>G</i>). The particular graphs I will chiefly discuss are the power graph,
enhanced power graph, deep commuting graph, commuting graph, and non-generating
graph.
</p>
<p>
My main concern is not with properties of these graphs individually, but
rather with comparisons between them. The graphs mentioned, together
with the null and complete graphs, form a hierarchy (as long as <i>G</i> is
non-abelian), in the sense that the edge set of any one is contained in that
of the next; interesting questions involve when two graphs in the hierarchy
are equal, or what properties the difference between them has. I also
consider various properties such as universality and forbidden subgraphs,
comparing how these properties play out in the different graphs.
</p>
<p>
I have also included some results on intersection graphs of subgroups of
various types, which are often in a "dual" relation to one of the other
graphs considered. Another actor is the Gruenberg--Kegel graph, or prime graph,
of a group: this very small graph has a surprising influence over various
graphs defined on the group.
</p>
<p>
Other graphs which have been proposed, such as the nilpotence, solvability,
and Engel graphs, will be touched on rather more briefly. My emphasis is on
finite groups but there is a short section on results for infinite groups.
There are briefer discussions of general Aut(<i>G</i>)-invariant graphs,
and structures other than groups (such as semigroups and rings).
</p>
<p>
Proofs, or proof sketches, of known results have been included where possible.
Also, many open questions are stated, in the hope of stimulating further
investigation.

A transversal property for permutation groups motivated by partial transformations, <em>J. Algebra</em>  <b>573</b> (2021), 741-759
</p>
<p>
In this paper we introduce the definition of the (<i>k,l</i>)-universal
transversal property for permutation groups, which is a refinement of the
definition of <i>k</i>-universal transversal property, which in turn is a
refinement of the classical definition of <i>k</i>-homogeneity for permutation
groups. In particular, a group possesses the (2,<i>n</i>)-universal transversal
property if and only if it is primitive; it possesses the (2,2)-universal
transversal property if and only if it is 2-homogeneous. Up to a few undecided
cases, we give a classification of groups satisfying the 
(<i>k,l</i>)-universal transversal property, for <i>k</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3.
Then we apply this result for studying regular semigroups of partial
transformations.

For a nilpotent group <i>G</i>, let &Xi;(<i>G</i>) be the difference between the
complement of the generating graph of <i>G</i> and the commuting graph of
<i>G</i>, with vertices corresponding to central elements of <i>G</i> removed.
That is, &Xi;(<i>G</i>) has vertex set <i>G</i>&setminus;<i>Z</i>(<i>G</i>),
with two vertices adjacent if and only if they do not commute and do not
generate <i>G</i>. Additionally, let &Xi;<sup>+</sup>(<i>G</i>) be the subgraph
of &Xi;(G) induced by its non-isolated vertices. We show that if &Xi;(G) has
an edge, then &Xi;<sup>+</sup>(<i>G</i>)$ is connected with diameter 2 or 3,
with &Xi;(<i>G</i>) = &Xi;<sup>+</sup>(<i>G</i>) in the diameter 3 case. In
the infinite case, our results apply more generally, to any group with every
maximal subgroup normal. When <i>G</i> is finite, we explore the relationship
between the structures of <i>G</i> and &Xi;(<i>G</i>) in more detail.

<i>G</i> which is generated by the derangements in <i>G</i>. Our main results
bound the index of this subgroup: we conjecture that, if <i>G</i> has degree
<i>n</i> and is not a Frobenius group, then
|<i>G</i>:<i>D</i>(<i>G</i>)|&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&radic;<i>n</i>&minus;1;
we prove this except when <i>G</i> is a primitive affine group. For affine
groups, we translate our conjecture into an equivalent form regarding
|<i>H</i>:<i>R</i>(<i>H</i>)|, where <i>H</i> is a linear group on a finite
vector space and <i>R</i>(<i>H</i>) is the subgroup of <i>H</i>$ generated by
elements having eigenvalue&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>
If <i>G</i> is a Frobenius group, then <i>D</i>(<i>G</i>) is the Frobenius
kernel, and so <i>G</i>/<i>D</i>(<i>G</i>) is isomorphic to a Frobenius
complement. We give some examples where <i>D</i>(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;<i>G</i>,
and examine the group-theoretic structure of <i>G</i>/<i>D</i>(<i>G</i>); in
particular, we construct groups <i>G</i> in which <i>G</i>/<i>D</i>(<i>G</i>)
is not a Frobenius complement.

Undirecting membership in models of ZFA,</a>,
<em>Aequationes Math.</em> <b>95</b> (2021), 393-400
</p>
<p>
It is known that, if we take a countable model of Zermelo&ndash;Fraenkel set
theory ZFC and "undirect" the membership relation (that is, make a graph by
joining <i>x</i>to <i>y</i> if either <i>x</i>&isin;<i>y</i> or 
<i>y</i>&isin;<i>x</i>), we obtain the Erd&#337;s&ndash;R&eacute;nyi
random graph. The crucial axiom in the proof of this is the Axiom of
Foundation; so it is natural to wonder what happens if we delete this axiom,
or replace it by an alternative (such as Aczel's Anti-Foundation Axiom).
The resulting graph may fail to be simple; it may have loops (if
<i>x</i>&isin;<i>x</i> for some <i>x</i>) or multiple edges (if
<i>x</i>&isin;<i>y</i> and <i>y</i>&isin;<i>x</i> for some distinct <i>x,y</i>).
We show that, in ZFA, if we keep the loops and ignore the multiple edges, we
obtain the "random loopy graph" (which is &aleph;<sub>0</sub>-categorical
and homogeneous), but if we keep multiple edges, the resulting graph is not
&aleph;<sub>0</sub>-categorical, but has infinitely many 1-types. Moreover, if
we keep only loops and double edges and discard single edges, the resulting
graph contains countably many connected components isomorphic to any given
finite connected graph with loops.

 The existential transversal property: a generalization of homogeneity and its

<em>Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.</em> <b>374</b> (2021), 1155-1195. 
</p>
<p>

Let <i>G</i> be a permutation group of degree <i>n</i>, and <i>k</i> a
positive integer with <i>k</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>n</i>. We say that <i>G</i>
has the <i>k</i>-existential property, or <i>k</i>-et, if there exists a
<i>k</i>-subset <i>A</i> of the domain &Omega; whose orbit under <i>G</i>
contains  transversals for all <i>k</i>-partitions <i>P</i> of &Omega;.
This property is a substantial weakening of the <i>k</i>-universal transversal
property, or <i>k</i>-ut, investigated by the first and third author, which
required this condition to hold for all <i>k</i>-subsets <i>A</i> of the
domain &Omega;.
</p>
<p>
Our first task in this paper is to investigate the <i>k</i>-et property and to
decide which groups satisfy it. For example, it is known that for
<i>k</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6 there are several families of <i>k</i>-transitive
groups, but for <i>k</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;6 the only ones are alternating or
symmetric groups; here we show that in the <i>k</i>-et context the threshold
is 8, that is, for 8&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>k</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>n</i>/2, the
only transitive groups with <i>k</i>-et are the symmetric and alternating
groups; this is best possible since the Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub> 
(degree 24) has 7-et. We determine all groups with <i>k</i>-et for
4&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>k</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>n</i>/2, up to some unresolved
cases for <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4,5, and describe the
property for <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,3 in permutation group language. These
considerations essentially answer Problem 5 proposed in the paper on 
<i>k</i>-ut referred to above; we also slightly improve the classification of
groups possessing the <i>k</i>-ut property.
</p>
<p>
In that earlier paper, the results were applied to semigroups, in
particular, to the question of when the semigroup &lang;<i>G,t</i>&rang; is
regular, where <i>t</i> is a map of rank <i>k</i> (with
<i>k</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>n</i>/2); this turned out to be
equivalent to the <i>k</i>-ut property. The question investigated here is when
there is a <i>k</i>-subset $A$ of the domain such that &lang;<i>G,t</i>&rang;
is regular for all maps <i>t</i> with image <i>A</i>. This turns out to be
much more delicate; the <i>k</i>-et property (with <i>A</i> as witnessing set)
is a necessary condition, and the combination of <i>k</i>-et and 
(<i>k</i>&minus;1)-ut is sufficient, but the truth lies somewhere between.
</p>
<p>
Given the knowledge that a group under consideration has the necessary
condition of <i>k</i>-et, the regularity question for
<i>k</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>n</i>/2 is solved except for one sporadic group.
</p>
<p>
The paper ends with a number of problems on combinatorics, permutation groups and transformation semigroups, and their linear analogues.

Square lattice designs are often used in trials of new varieties of various agricultural crops. However, there are no square lattice designs for 36 varieties in blocks of size six for four or more replicates. Here we use three different approaches to construct designs for up to eight replicates. All the designs perform well in terms of giving a low average variance of variety contrasts.

<p>
For a prime power <i>q</i> and a positive integer <i>n</i>, we say a subspace
<i>U</i> of <b>F</b><sub><i>q</i></sub><sup><i>n</i></sup> is <em>cyclically
covering</em> if the union of the cyclic shifts of <i>U</i> is equal to

determining the minimum possible dimension of a cyclically covering subspace
<b>F</b><sub><i>q</i></sub><sup><i>n</i></sup>. (This is a natural
generalisation of a problem posed in 1991 by the first author.) We prove
several upper and lower bounds, and for each fixed <i>q</i>, we answer the
question completely for infinitely many values of <i>n</i> (which take the
form of certain geometric series). Our results imply lower bounds for a
well-known conjecture of Isbell, and a generalisation theoreof, supplementing
lower bounds due to Spiga. We also consider the analogous problem for general
representations of groups. We use arguments from combinatorics, representation
theory and finite field theory.

The Hall&ndash;Paige conjecture, and synchronization for affine and diagonal
groups</a>, <em>J. Algebra</em> <b>545</b> (2020), 27-42
</p>
<p>
The Hall&ndash;Paige conjecture asserts that a finite group has a complete mapping
if and only if its Sylow subgroups are not cyclic. The conjecture is now proved,
and one aim of this paper is to document the final step in the proof (for the
sporadic simple group J<sub>4</sub>).
</p>
<p>
We apply this result to prove that primitive permutation groups of simple
diagonal type with three or more simple factors in the socle are
non-synchronizing. We also give the simpler proof that, for groups of affine
type, or simple diagonal type with two socle factors, synchronization and
separation are equivalent.
</p>
<p>
Synchronization and separation are conditions on permutation groups which are
stronger than primitivity but weaker than 2-homogeneity, the second of these
being stronger than the first. Empirically it has been found that groups which
are synchronizing but not separating are rather rare. It follows from our
results that such groups must be primitive of almost simple type.

Sesqui-arrays, a generalisation of triple arrays</a>, 
<em>Australas. J. Combinatorics</em> <b>71(3)</b> (2018), 427-451.
</p>
<p>
A triple array is a rectangular array containing letters, each letter occurring
equally often with no repeats in rows or columns, such that the number of
letters common to two rows, two columns, or a row and a column are (possibly
different) non-zero constants. Deleting the condition on the letters common to 
a row and a column gives a double array. We propose the term
<em>sesqui-array</em> for
such an array when only the condition on pairs of columns is deleted.
</p>
<p>
In this paper we give three constructions for sesqui-arrays. The first gives
(<i>n</i>+1)&times;<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> arrays on <i>n</i>(<i>n</i>+1) letters
for <i>n</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2. (Such an array
for <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 was found by Bagchi.) This construction uses 
Latin squares.
The second uses the <em>Sylvester graph</em>, a subgraph of the
Hoffman&ndash;Singleton graph,
to build a good block design for 36 treatments in 42 blocks of size 6, and then
uses this in a 7&times;36 sesqui-array for 42 letters.
</p>
<p>
We also give a construction for
<i>K</i>&times;(<i>K</i>&minus;1)(<i>K</i>&minus;2)/2 sesqui-arrays on
<i>K</i>(<i>K</i>&minus;1)/2 letters from biplanes. The construction
starts with a block of a biplane and produces an array which satisfies the
requirements for a sesqui-array except possibly that of having no
repeated letters in a row or column. We show that this condition holds if
and only if the <em>Hussain chains</em> for the selected block contain no
4-cycles. A sufficient condition for the construction to give a triple
array is that each Hussain chain is a union of 3-cycles; but this condition
is not necessary, and we give a few further examples.
</p>
<p>
We also discuss the question of which of these arrays provide good designs
for experiments.

Recently Peter Keevash solved asymptotically the existence question for Steiner systems by showing that <i>S</i>(<i>t,k,n</i>)$ exists whenever the necessary divisibility conditions on the parameters are satisfied and <i>n</i> is sufficiently large in terms of <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>. The purpose of this paper is to make a conjecture which if true would be a significant extension of Keevash's theorem, and to give some theoretical and computational evidence for the conjecture.
</p>
<p>
We phrase the conjecture in terms of the notions (which we define here) of synchronization and separation for association schemes. These definitions are based on those for permutation groups which grow out of the theory of synchronization in finite automata. In this theory, two classes of permutation groups (called <em>synchronizing</em> and <em>separating</em>) lying between primitive and 2-homogeneous are defined. A big open question is how the permutation group induced by <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> on <i>k</i>-subsets of {1,&hellip;,<i>n</i>} fits in this hierarchy; our conjecture would give a solution to this problem for <i>n</i>
large in terms of <i>k</i>.

<p>
The <em>power graph</em> P(<i>G</i>) of a group <i>G</i> is the graph whose
vertex set is <i>G</i>, with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> joined if one is a power of
the other; the <em>directed power graph</em> P<sup>&rarr;</sup>(<i>G</i>) has
the same vertex set, with an arc from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> if <i>y</i> is a

the power graph determines the directed power graph up to isomorphism. However,
it is not true that any isomorphism between power graphs induces an isomorphism
between directed power graphs. Moreover, for infinite groups the power graph
may fail to determine the directed power graph.
</p>
<p>
In this paper, we consider power graphs of torsion-free groups. Our main
results are that, for torsion-free nilpotent groups of class at most 2,
and for groups in which every non-identity element lies in a unique maximal
cyclic subgroup,
the power graph determines the directed power graph up to isomorphism. For
specific groups such as <b>Z</b> and <b>Q</b>, we obtain more precise
results. Any isomorphism P(<b>Z</b>)\to P(<i>G</i>) preserves orientation, so
induces an isomorphism between directed power graphs; in the case of

We also obtain results about groups in which every element is contained in a
unique maximal cyclic subgroup (this class includes the free and free abelian
groups), and about subgroups of the additive group of <b>Q</b> and about

The cycle polynomial of a permutation group,

The cycle polynomial of a finite permutation group G is the generating function for the number of elements of G with a given number of cycles:
<p>
<p align="center">
<i>F<sub>G</sub></i>(<i>x</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Sigma;<i>x</i><sup><i>c</i>(<i>g</i>)</sup>:<i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i>,

</p>
<p>
In the 1970s, Richard Stanley introduced the notion of reciprocity for pairs of combinatorial polynomials. We show that, in a considerable number of cases, there is a polynomial in the reciprocal relation to the cycle polynomial of <i>G</i>; this is the orbital chromatic polynomial of &Gamma; and <i>G</i>, where &Gamma; is a <i>G</i>-invariant graph, introduced by the first author, Jackson and Rudd. We pose the general problem of finding all such reciprocal pairs, and give a number of examples and characterisations: the latter include the cases where &Gamma; is a complete or null graph or a tree.

The paper concludes with some comments on other polynomials associated with a permutation group.

We are interested in semigroups of the form &lang;<i>G,a</i>&rang;\<i>G</i>, where <i>G</i> is a permutation group of degree <i>n</i> and <i>a</i> a non-permutation on the domain of <i>G</i>. A theorem of the first author, Mitchell and Schneider shows that, if this semigroup is idempotent-generated for all possible choices of <i>a</i>, then <i>G</i> is the symmetric or alternating group of degree <i>n</i>, with three exceptions (having <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 or <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;6). Our purpose here is to prove stronger results where we assume that &lang;<i>G,a</i>&rang;\<i>G</i> is idempotent-generated for all maps of fixed rank <i>k</i>. For <i>k</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;6 and <i>n</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2<i>k</i>+1, we reach the same conclusion, that <i>G</i> is symmetric or alternating. These results are proved using a stronger version of the <i>k</i>-<em>universal transversal property</em> previously considered by the authors.
</p>
<p>
In the case <i>k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, we show that idempotent generation of the semigroup for all choices of <i>a</i> is equivalent to a condition on the permutation group G, stronger than primitivity, which we call the <em>road closure condition</em>. We cannot determine all the primitive groups with this property, but we give a conjecture about their classification, and a body of evidence (both theoretical and computational) in support of the conjecture.

<p>
The paper ends with some problems.

Imprimitive permutations in primitive groups,</a>
<em>J. Algebra</em> <b>115</b> (2017), 135-176
</p>
<p>
The goal of this paper is to study  primitive groups  that are contained in the union of maximal (in the symmetric group) imprimitive groups. The study of types of permutations that appear inside primitive groups. The study of types of permutations that appear inside primitive groups goes back to the origins of the theory of permutation groups. However, this is another instance of a situation common in mathematics in which a very natural problem turns out to be extremely difficult. Fortunately, the enormous progresses of the last few decades seem to allow a new momentum on the attack to this problem. In this paper we prove that there are infinite families of primitive groups contained in the union of imprimitive groups and propose a new hierarchy for primitive groups based on that fact. In addition to the previous results and hierarchy, we introduce some algorithms to handle permutations, provide the corresponding GAP implementation, solve some open problems, and propose a large list of open problems.

Algebraic properties of chromatic roots,
<em>Electronic J. Combinatorics</em> <b>24(1)</b> (2017), paper #P1.21
</p>
<p>
A <em>chromatic root</em> is a root of the chromatic polynomial of a graph.  Any chromatic root is an algebraic integer. Much is known about the location of chromatic roots in the real and complex numbers, but rather less about their properties as algebraic numbers. This question was the subject of a seminar at the Isaac Newton Institute in late 2008.  The purpose of this paper is to report on the seminar and subsequent developments.
</p>
<p>
We conjecture that, for every algebraic integer &alpha;, there is a natural number <i>n</i>$ such that &alpha;+<i>n</i> is a chromatic root. This is proved for quadratic integers; an extension to cubic integers has been found by Adam Bohn. The idea is to consider certain special classes of graphs for which the chromatic polynomial is a product of linear factors and one "interesting" factor of larger degree. We also report computational results on the Galois groups of irreducible factors of the chromatic polynomial for some special graphs. Finally, extensions to the Tutte polynomial are mentioned briefly.

</p>
<p>
We investigate the extent to which the exchange relation holds in
finite groups <i>G</i>. We define a new equivalence relation
where two elements are equivalent if each can be substituted for the other
in any generating set for <i>G</i>. We then refine this to a new sequence of
equivalence relations by saying that two elements are equivalent in the
<i>r</i>th relation if each can be substituted for the other in any
<i>r</i>-element generating set.
The relations become finer as <i>r</i> increases, and
we define a new group invariant &psi;(<i>G</i>) to be the value of <i>r</i>
at which they stabilise.
</p> 
<p>
Remarkably, we are able to prove that if <i>G</i> is soluble then
&psi;(<i>G</i>)&isin;{<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>),<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>)+1}, where
<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>) is the minimum number of generators of <i>G</i>, and 
to classify the finite soluble groups <i>G</i> for which
&psi;(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>). For insoluble <i>G</i>, we
show that
<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&psi;(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>)+5. However, we know of no examples of
groups <i>G</i> for which &psi;(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>d</i>(<i>G</i>)+1. 
</p>
<p>
As an application, we look at the <em>generating graph</em> of <i>G</i>,
whose vertices are the elements of <i>G</i>, the edges being the 2-element
generating sets. Our level-2 relation enables 
us to calculate Aut(&Gamma;(<i>G</i>)) for all soluble groups <i>G</i> of
nonzero spread, and give detailed structural information about
Aut(&Gamma;(<i>G</i>)) in the insoluble case.

Triple arrays from difference sets</a>,

</p>
<p>
This paper addresses the question whether triple arrays can be constructed from Youden squares developed from difference sets. We prove that if the difference set is abelian, then having &minus;1 as multiplier is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the construction to work. Using this, we are able to give a new infinite family of triple arrays. We also give an alternative and more direct version of the construction, leaving out the intermediate step via Youden squares. This is used when we analyse the case of non-abelian difference sets, for which we prove a sufficient condition for giving triple arrays. We do a computer search for such non-abelian difference sets, but have not found any examples satisfying the given condition.

We characterise the automorphism groups of the Higman groups

continues a thread of research begun by Brin, and extended later by Brin and

of Richard Thompson,' as Brin referred to them in 1996. The work here completes
the first stage of that twenty-year-old program, containing (amongst other
things) a characterisation of the automorphism group of <i>V</i>, which was
the 'last chameleon.' As it happens, the homeomorphisms which arise naturally
fit into the framework of Grigorchuk, Nekrashevich, and Suschanski&#301;'s
rational group of transducers, and exhibit fascinating connections with the
theory of reset words for automata (arising in the Road Colouring Problem),
while also appearing to offer insight into the nature of Brin and

Furthermore, it is proved that for every group <i>G</i>, the clique number of the power graph of <i>G</i> is at most countably infinite. We also measure how close the power graph is to the <em>commuting graph</em> by introducing a new graph which lies in between. We call this new graph as the <em>enhanced power graph</em>.

Lengths of words in transformation semigroups generated by digraphs</a>,

Given a simple digraph <i>D</i> on <i>n</i> vertices (with
<i>n</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2), there is a natural construction of a semigroup
&lang;<i>D</i>&rang; associated with <i>D</i>. For any edge (<i>a,b</i>) of 
<i>D</i>, let <i>a</i>&rarr;<i>b</i> be the idempotent of defect 1 mapping
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i> and fixing all vertices other than <i>a</i>; then define
&lang;<i>D</i>&rang; to be the semigroup
&lang;<i>a</i>&rarr;<i>b</i>:(<i>a,b</i>)&isin;<i>E</i>(<i>D</i>)⟩.
For &alpha;&isin;&lang;<i>D</i>&rang;, let <i>l</i>(<i>D</i>,&alpha;) be the
minimal length of a word in <i>E</i>(<i>D</i>) expressing &alpha;. When
<i>D</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>K<sub>n</sub></i> is the complete undirected graph,

no analogous nontrivial results are known when

An automaton is said to be synchronizing if there is a word in the transitions
which sends all states of the automaton to a single state. Research on this
topic has been driven by the &#268;ern&yacute; conjecture, one of the oldest
and most famous problems in automata theory, according to which a
synchronizing <i>n</i>-state automaton has a reset word of length at most
(<i>n</i>&minus;1)<sup>2</sup>. The transitions of an automaton generate a
transformation monoid on the set of states, and so an automaton can be
regarded as a transformation monoid with a prescribed set of generators. In
this setting, an automaton is synchronizing if the transitions generate a
constant map. A permutation group <i>G</i> on a set &Omega; is said to
synchronize a map <i>f</i> if the monoid &lang;<i>G,f</i>&rang; generated by
<i>G</i> and <i>f</i> is synchronizing in the above sense; we say <i>G</i> is
synchronizing if it synchronizes every non-permutation.
</p>
<p>
The classes of synchronizing groups and friends form an hierarchy of natural
and elegant classes of groups lying strictly between the classes of primitive
and 2-homogeneous groups. These classes have been floating around for some
years and it is now time to provide a unified reference on them. The study of
all these classes has been prompted by the &#268;ern&yacute; conjecture, but
it is of independent interest since it involves a rich mix of group theory,
combinatorics, graph endomorphisms, semigroup theory, finite geometry, and
representation theory, and has interesting computational aspects as well. So
as to make the paper self-contained, we have provided background material on
these topics. Our purpose here is to present results that show the connections
between the various areas of mathematics mentioned above, we include a new
result on the &#268;ern&yacute; conjecture, some challenges to finite
geometers, some thoughts about infinite analogues, and a long list of open
problems.

<p>
Let &Omega; be a set of cardinality <i>n</i>, <i>G</i> a permutation group on &Omega;, and <i>f</i>:&Omega;&rarr;&Omega; a map which is not a permutation. We say that <i>G</i> <em>synchronizes</em> <i>f</i> if the transformation semigroup &lang;<i>G,f</i>&rang; contains a constant map, and that <i>G</i> is a <em>synchronizing group</em> if <i>G</i> synchronizes <em>every</em> non-permutation.
</p>
<p>
A synchronizing group is necessarily primitive, but there are primitive groups that are not synchronizing. Every non-synchronizing primitive group fails to synchronize at least one uniform transformation (that is, transformation whose kernel has parts of equal size), and it had previously been conjectured that this was essentially the only way in which a primitive group could fail to be synchronizing &mdash; in other words, that a primitive group synchronizes every non-uniform transformation.
</p>
<p>
The first goal of this paper is to prove that this conjecture is false, by exhibiting primitive groups that fail to synchronize specific non-uniform transformations of ranks 5 and 6. As it has previously been shown that primitive groups synchronize every non-uniform transformation of rank at most 4, these examples are of the lowest possible rank. In addition we produce graphs with primitive automorphism groups that have approximately &radic;<i>n</i> <em>non-synchronizing ranks</em>, thus refuting another conjecture on the number of non-synchronizing ranks of a primitive group.
<p>
</p>
The second goal of this paper is to extend the spectrum of ranks for which it is known that primitive groups synchronize every non-uniform transformation of that rank. It has previously been shown that a primitive group of degree <i>n</i> synchronizes every non-uniform transformation of rank <i>n</i>&minus;1 and <i>n</i>&minus;2, and here this is extended to <i>n</i>&minus;3 and <i>n</i>&minus;4.
</p>
<p>
Determining the exact spectrum of ranks for which there exist non-uniform transformations not synchronized by some primitive group is just one of several  natural, but possibly difficult, problems on automata, primitive groups, graphs and computational algebra arising from this work; these are outlined in the final section.

<p>
Let <i>X</i> be a finite set such that |<i>X</i>|&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>n</i>,
and let <i>k</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>n</i>/2. A group is <i>k</i>-homogeneous
if it has only one orbit on the sets of size <i>k</i>. The aim of this paper
is to prove some general results on permutation groups and then apply them to
transformation semigroups. On groups we find the minimum number of permutations
needed to generate <i>k</i>-homogeneous groups (for <i>k</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1);
in particular we show that 2-homogeneous groups are 2-generated. We also
describe the orbits of <i>k</i>-homogenous groups on partitions with
<i>n</i>&minus;<i>k</i> parts, classify the 3-homogeneous groups <i>G</i>
whose orbits on (<i>n</i>&minus;3)-partitions are invariant under the
normalizer of <i>G</i> in <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, and describe the normalizers
of 2-homogeneous groups in the symmetric group. Then these results are applied
to extract information about transformation semigroups with given group of
units, namely to prove results on their automorphisms and on the minimum
number of generators. The paper finishes with some problems on permutation
groups, transformation semigroups and computational algebra.

<p>
Let &lambda;&nbsp;=&nbsp;(&lambda;<sub>1</sub>,&lambda;<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;) be a <em>partition</em> of <i>n</i>, a sequence of positive integers in non-increasing order with sum <i>n</i>. Let &Omega;&nbsp;:=&nbsp;{1,&hellip;,<i>n</i>}.

</p>
<p>
Following Martin and Sagan, we say that <i>G</i> is &lambda;-<em>transitive</em> if, for any two ordered partitions <i>P</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>A</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>A</i><sub>2</sub>,&hellip;) and <i>Q</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>B</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>B</i><sub>2</sub>,&hellip;) of &Omega; of type &lambda;, there exists <i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i> with <i>A<sub>i</sub>g</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>B<sub>i</sub></i> for all <i>i</i>. A group <i>G</i> is said to be &lambda;-<em>homogeneous</em> if, given two ordered partitions <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> as above, inducing the sets <i>P'</i> and <i>Q'</i>, there exists <i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i> such that <i>P'g</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>Q'</i>. Clearly a &lambda;-transitive group is &lambda;-homogeneous.
</p>
<p>
The first goal of this paper is to classify the &lambda;-homogeneous groups (Theorems 1.1 and 1.2). The second goal is to apply this classification to a problem isn semigroup theory.
</p>
<p>
Let <i>T<sub>n</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> denote the transformation monoid and the symmetric group on &Omega;, respectively. Fix a group <i>H</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>T<sub>n</sub></i>. Given a non-invertible transformation <i>a</i> in <i>T<sub>n</sub></i> and a group <i>G</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, we say that (<i>a,G</i>) is an <i>H</i>-<em>pair</em> if the semigroups generated by {<i>a</i>}&cup;<i>H</i> and {<i>a</i>}&cup;<i>G</i> contain the same non-units. Using the classification of the &lambda;-homogeneous groups we classify all the <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>-pairs (Theorem 1.7). For a multitude of transformation semigroups this theorem immediately implies a description of their automorphisms, congruences, generators and other relevant properties (Theorem 8.5).
</p>
<p>
This topic involves both group theory and semigroup theory; we have attempted to include enough exposition to make the paper self-contained for researchers in both areas.
</p>
<p>
The paper finishes with a number of open problems on permutation and linear groups.

A classic result of Delsarte connects the strength (as orthogonal array)
of a linear code with the minimum weight of its dual: the former is one
less than the latter.

Since the paper of Hammons <em>et al.</em>, there is a lot of interest in

Chains of subsemigroups</a>, <em>Israel J. Math.</em> 
</p>
<p>
  We investigate the maximum length of a chain of subsemigroups in various
  classes of semigroups, such as the full transformation semigroups, the general
  linear semigroups, and the semigroups of order-preserving transformations of
  finite chains. In some cases, we give lower bounds for the total number of
  subsemigroups of these semigroups. We give general results for finite
  completely regular and finite inverse semigroups. Wherever possible, we state
  our results in the greatest generality; in particular, we include infinite
  semigroups where the result is true for these.
</p>
<p>
  The length of a subgroup chain in a group is bounded by the logarithm of the
  group order. This fails for semigroups, but it is perhaps surprising that
  there is a lower bound for the length of a subsemigroup chain in the full
  transformation semigroup which is a constant multiple of the semigroup order.

J. M. Howie, the influential St Andrews semigroupist, claimed that we
value an area of pure mathematics to the extent that (a) it gives rise to
arguments that are deep and elegant, and (b) it has interesting
interconnections with other parts of pure mathematics.
</p>
<p>
This paper surveys some recent results on the transformation semigroup
generated by a permutation group <i>G</i> and a single non-permutation <i>a</i>.
Our particular concern is the influence that properties of <i>G</i> (related to
homogeneity, transitivity and primitivity) have on the structure of the
semigroup. In the first part of the paper, we consider properties of
<i>S</i>=&lang;<i>G,a</i>&rang; such as regularity and generation. The second
is a brief report on the synchronization project, which aims to decide
in what circumstances <i>S</i> contains an element of rank 1. The paper closes
with a list of open problems on permutation groups and linear groups, and some
comments about the impact on semigroups are provided.
</p>
<p>
These two research directions outlined above lead to very interesting and
challenging problems on primitive permutation groups whose solutions require
combining results from several different areas of mathematics, certainly
fulfilling both of Howie's elegance and value tests in a new and fascinating
way.

Guessing games on triangle-free graphs</a>,
<em>Electronic J. Combinatorics</em> <b>23(1)</b> (2016), Paper #1.48
</p>
<p>
The guessing game introduced by Riis is a variant of the "guessing your own
hats" game and can be played on any simple directed graph <i>G</i> on 
<i>n</i> vertices. For each digraph <i>G</i>, it is proved that there exists
a unique guessing number gn(<i>G</i>) associated to the guessing game played
on <i>G</i>. When we consider the directed edge to be bidirected, in other
words, the graph <i>G</i> is undirected, Christofides and Markstom introduced
a method to bound the value of the guessing number from below using the
fractional clique number Kf(<i>G</i>). In particular they showed 
gn(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;|<i>V</i>(<i>G</i>)|&minus;Kf(<i>G</i>).
Moreover, it is pointed out that equality holds in this bound if the
underlying undirected graph G falls into one of the following categories:
perfect graphs, cycle graphs or their complement. In this paper, we show
that there are triangle-free graphs that have guessing numbers which do not
meet the fractional clique cover bound. In particular, the famous
triangle-free Higman&ndash;Sims graph has guessing number at least 77 and at
most 78, while the bound given by fractional clique cover is 50.

Given a graph <i>G</i> on <i>n</i> vertices, for which <i>m</i> is it possible
to partition the edge set of the <i>m</i>-fold complete graph
<i>mK<sub>n</sub></i> into copies of <i>G</i>? We show that there is an

give an integer <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> which divides <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>; we

outline some connections between our problem and the existence of designs of

Most switching classes with primitive automorphism groups

</p>
</p>
<p>
The operation of switching a graph &Gamma; with respect to a subset <i>X</i>
of the vertex set interchanges edges and non-edges between <i>X</i> and
its complement, leaving the rest of the graph unchanged. This is an
equivalence relation on the set of graphs on a given vertex set, so we can
talk about the automorphism group of a switching class of graphs.
</p>
<p>
It might be thought that switching classes with many automorphisms would have
the property that all their graphs also have many automorphisms. However the
main theorem of this paper shows a different picture: with finitely many
exceptions, if a non-trivial switching class <i>S</i> has primitive
automorphism group, then it contains a graph whose automorphism group is
trivial. We also find all the exceptional switching classes; up to
complementation, there are just six.

Computing in matrix groups without memory,

</p>

<p>
Memoryless computation is a novel means of computing any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. We aim to emulate how computations are performed on modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The computation model of memoryless computation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory. We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed. We also determine which linear functions are hardest to compute when the field in question is the binary field and the number of registers is even. Secondly, we investigate some matrix groups, thus showing that the special linear group is internally computable but not fast. Thirdly, we determine the smallest set of instructions required to generate the special and general linear groups. These results are important for memoryless computation, for they show that linear functions can be computed very fast or that very few instructions are needed to compute any linear function. They thus indicate new advantages of using memoryless computation.

<p>
Memoryless computation is a new technique to compute any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. Its aim is to emulate how computations are performed in modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The memoryless computation model can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we consider how efficiently permutations can be computed without memory. We determine the minimum number of basic updates required to compute any permutation, or any even permutation. The small number of required instructions shows that very small instruction sets could be encoded on cores to perform memoryless computation. We then start looking at a possible compromise between the size of the instruction set and the length of the resulting programs. We consider updates only involving a limited number of registers. In particular, we show that binary instructions are not enough to compute all permutations without memory when the alphabet size is even. These results, though expressed as properties of special generating sets of the symmetric or alternating groups, provide guidelines on the implementation of memoryless computation.

Primitive groups synchronize non-uniform maps of extreme ranks</a>,
<em>J. Combinatorial Theory</em> (B) <b>106</b> (2014), 98-114.
</p>
<p>
Let &Omega; be a set of cardinality <i>n</i>,
<i>G</i> a permutation group on &Omega;, and <i>f</i>:&Omega;&rarr;&Omega;
a map which is not a permutation. We say that <i>G</i> synchronizes <i>f</i>
if the semigroup &lang;<i>G,f</i>&rang; contains a constant map.
</p>
<p>
The first author has conjectured that a primitive group synchronizes
any map whose kernel is non-uniform. Rystsov proved one instance of this
conjecture, namely, degree <i>n</i>  primitive groups synchronize maps of
rank <i>n</i>&minus;1 (thus, maps with kernel type (2,1,&hellip;,1)). We
prove some extensions of Rystsov's result, including this: a primitive group
synchronizes every map whose kernel type is (<i>k</i>,1,&hellip;,1).
Incidentally this result provides a new characterization of imprimitive groups.
 We also  prove that  the conjecture above holds for maps of extreme ranks,
that is, ranks 3, 4 and <i>n</i>&minus;2.
</p>
<p>
These proofs use a graph-theoretic
technique due to the second author: a transformation semigroup fails to
contain a constant map if and only if it is contained in the endomorphism
semigroup of a non-null (simple undirected) graph.
</p>
<p>
The paper finishes with a number of open problems, whose solutions will certainly require very delicate graph theoretical considerations.

<p>
This paper concerns the general problem of classifying the deterministic
automata that admit a synchronizing (or reset) word. (For our purposes it
is irrelevant if the automata have initial or finite states.) Our departure
point is the study of the transition semigroup associated to the automaton
and then we take advantage of the enormous and very deep progress made during
the last decades on the theory of permutation groups, their geometry and
combinatorial structure. Our main results provide infinite families of
automata admitting a synchronizing (or reset) word.

Let <i>X</i> be a finite set and let <i>G</i> be a primitive group of
permutations on <i>X</i>. It is well known (by some recent results proved by
P.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Neumann) that for some such <i>G</i> and some singular
transformations <i>t</i> of uniform kernel (that is, all blocks have the same
number of elements), the semigroup &lang;<i>G,g</i>&rang; does not generate
a constant map. We say that a primitive group <i>G</i> on <i>X</i> is
<em>almost synchronizing</em> if <i>G</i> together with any map of
non-uniform kernel generates a constant. In this paper we provide two methods
to build almost synchronizing groups and provide several families of such
groups.

The paper ends with a number of problems likely to attract the attention of

Let <i>X</i> be a finite set such that |<i>X</i>|&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>n</i>. Let
<i>T<sub>n</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> denote respectively the 
transformation monoid and the symmetric group on <i>n</i> points. Given

If <i>G</i> is <i>a</i>-normalizing for all

the we say that <i>G</i> is normalizing. The goal of this paper is to
classify normalizing groups and hence answer a question posed elsewhere.

Two generalizations of homogeneity in groups with applications to regular

</p>
<p>
Let <i>X</i> be a finite set such that |<i>X</i>|=<i>n</i> and
let <i>i</i>&le;<i>j</i>&le;<i>n</i>. A group <i>G</i>&le;<i>S<sub>n</sub></i>
is said to be (<i>i,j</i>)-homogeneous if for every <i>I,J</i>&sube;<i>X</i>,
such that |<i>I</i>|=<i>i</i> and |<i>J</i>|=<i>j</i>, there exists
<i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i> such that <i>Ig&sube;J</i>. (Clearly
(<i>i,i</i>)-homogeneity is <i>i</i>-homogeneity in the usual sense.)
</p>
<p>
A group <i>G</i>&le;<i>S<sub>n</sub></i> is said to have the <i>k</i>-universal
transversal property if given any set <i>I</i>&sube;X</i> (with
|<i>I</i>|=<i>k</i>) and any partition <i>P</i> of <i>X</i> into <i>k</i>
blocks, there exists <i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i> such that <i>Ig</i> is a section
for <i>P</i>. (That is, the orbit of each <i>k</i>-subset of <i>X</i> contains
a section for each <i>k</i>-partition of <i>X</i>.)
</p>
<p>
In this paper we classify the groups with the <i>k</i>-universal transversal
property (with the exception of two classes of 2-homogeneous groups) and the
(<i>k</i>&minus;1,<i>k</i>)-homogeneous groups (for
2&lt;<i>k</i>&le;(<i>n</i>+1)/2). As a corollary of the classification we prove
that a (<i>k</i>&minus;1,<i>k</i>)-homogeneous group is also
(<i>k</i>&minus;2,<i>k</i>&minus;1)-homogeneous, with two exceptions; and
similarly, but with no exceptions, groups having the <i>k</i>-universal
transversal property have the (<i>k</i>&minus;1)-universal transversal property.</p>
<p>
A corollary of all the previous results is a  classification of  the groups
that together with any rank <i>k</i> transformation on <i>X</i> generate a
regular semigroup (for 1&le;<i>k</i>&le;(<i>n</i>+1)/2).

A statistician designing an experiment wants to get as much information as
possible from the data gathered. Often this means the most precise estimate
possible (that is, an estimate with minimum possible variance) of the
unknown parameters. If there are several parameters, this can be interpreted
in many ways: do we want to minimize the average variance, or the maximum
variance, or the volume of a confidence region for the parameters?
</p>
<p>
In the case of block designs, these optimality criteria can be calculated
from the concurrence graph of the design, and in many cases from its
Laplacian eigenvalues.  The Levi graph can also be used.
The various criteria turn out to be closely connected
with other properties of the graph as a network, such as number of spanning
trees, isoperimetric number, and the sum of the resistances between pairs
of vertices when the graph
is regarded as an electrical network.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, we discuss the notions of optimality for incomplete-block
designs, explain the graph-theoretic connections, and prove some old and new
results about optimality.

We define a new parameter, called <em>remoteness</em>, of a subset of a finite
metric space. It is related to domination and is, in a sense, dual to covering
radius. We study this parameter in the symmetric group (with the Hamming
metric, where the distance between two permutations is the number of positions
in which they differ). We obtain a number of results for sets and groups of
permutations. In particular, the remoteness of a transitive permutation group
of degree <i>n</i> is either <i>n</i> or <i>n</i>&minus;1, and we give a number
of results about which possibility occurs, though without resolving the
question completely.

This paper introduces combinatorial representations, which generalise the notion of linear representations of matroids. We show that any family of subsets of the same cardinality has a combinatorial representation via matrices. We then prove that any graph is representable over all alphabets of size larger than some number depending on the graph. We also provide a characterisation of families representable over a given alphabet. Then, we associate a rank function and a rank operator to any representation which help us determine some criteria for the functions used in a representation. While linearly representable matroids can be viewed as having representations via matrices with only one row, we conclude this paper by an investigation of representations via matrices with only two rows.

<a name="p288">Peter J. Cameron, Dixon's Theorem and random synchronization</a>,
<em>Discrete Mathematics</em>
<b>313</b> (2013), 1233-1236.
</p>
<p>
A transformation monoid on a set &Omega; is called <em>synchronizing</em> if
it contains an element of rank 1 (that is, mapping the whole of &Omega;
to a single point). In this paper, I tackle the question: given <i>n</i> and
<i>k</i>, what is the probability that the submonoid of the full transformation
monoid <i>T<sub>n</sub></i> generated by <i>k</i> random transformations is
synchronizing?
</p>
<p>
The question has some similarities with a similar question about the probability
that the subgroup of <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> generated by <i>k</i> random
permutations is transitive. For <i>k</i>=1, the answer is 1/<i>n</i>; for
<i>k</i>=2, Dixon's Theorem asserts that it is 1-o(1) as <i>n</i>&rarr;&infin;
(and good estimates are now known). For our synchronization question, for
<i>k</i>=1 the answer is also 1/<i>n</i>; I conjecture
that for <i>k</i>=2 it is also 1-o(1).
</p>
<p>
Following the technique of Dixon's theorem, we need to analyse the maximal
non-synchronizing submonoids of <i>T<sub>n</sub></i>. I develop a very close
connection
between transformation monoids and graphs, from which we obtain a description
of non-synchronizing monoids as endomorphism monoids of graphs satisfying some
very strong conditions. However, counting such graphs,
and dealing with the intersections of their endomorphism monoids, seems
difficult.

We develop a new setting for the exponential principle in the context

instead of being given in advance. Our approach uses the language of

and we show that, somewhat surprisingly,

<p>
The multivariate Tutte polynomial <i>Z</i>^<sub><i>M</i></sub> of a
matroid <i>M</i> is a generalisation of the standard two-variable version,
obtained by assigning a separate variable <i>v<sub>e</sub></i> to each element
<i>e</i> of the ground set. It encodes the full structure of <i>M</i>. 
Let <b>v</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{<i>v<sub>e</sub></i>}, let <i>K</i> be an arbitrary
field, and suppose <i>M</i> is connected. We prove that 
<i>Z</i>^<sub><i>M</i></sub> is irreducible over <i>K</i>(<b>v</b>),
and show that the Galois group of <i>Z</i>^<sub><i>M</i></sub> over
<i>K</i>(<b>v</b>) is the symmetric group of degree <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i>
is the rank of <i>M</i>. An immediate consequence of this result is that the
Galois group of the multivariate Tutte polynomial of any matroid is a direct
product of symmetric groups. We also report on the implications of our work
for the graph-theoretical formulation of the multivariate Tutte polynomial.
In particular we show that our main theorem holds for biconnected graphs, and
conjecture a similar result for the standard Tutte polynomial of such a graph.

</p>

<p>
To a combinatorialist, a design is usually a 2-design (or balanced
incomplete-block design). However, 2-designs do not necessarily exist
in all cases where a statistician might wish to use one to design an
experiment. As a result, statisticians need to consider structures much
more general than the combinatorialist's designs, and to decide which one
is "best" in a given situation. This leads to the theory of optimal
design. There are several concepts of optimality, and no general consensus
about which one to use in any particular situation.
</p>

<p>
For block designs with fixed block size <i>k</i>, all these optimality criteria
are determined by a graph, the <i>concurrence graph</i> of the design, and
more specifically, by the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the graph.
It turns out that the optimality criteria most used by statisticians
correspond to
properties of this graph which are interesting in other contexts:
D-optimality involves
maximizing the number of spanning trees; A-optimality involves minimizing
the sum of resistances between all pairs of terminals (when the graph is
regarded as an electrical circuit, with each edge being a one-ohm resistor);
and E-optimality involves maximizing the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian
(the corresponding graphs are likely to have good expansion and random walk
properties).
If you are familiar with these properties, you may expect
that related "nice" properties such as regularity and large girth (or
even symmetry) may tend to hold; some of our examples may come as a surprise!
</p>

<p>
The aim of this paper is to point out that the optimal design point of view
unifies various topics in graph theory and design theory, and suggests some
interesting open problems to which combinatorialists of all kinds might turn
their expertise. We describe in some detail both the statistical background
and the mathematics of various topics such as Laplace eigenvalues of graphs.

<p>
A permutation group <i>G</i> (acting on a set Omega, usually infinite)
is said to be <i>oligomorphic</i> if <i>G</i> has only finitely many orbits
on Omega<sup><i>n</i></sup> (the set of <i>n</i>-tuples of elements of Omega). 
Such groups
have traditionally been linked with model theory and combinatorial
enumeration; more recently their group-theoretic properties have been
studied, and links with graded algebras, Ramsey theory, topological dynamics,
and other areas have emerged.
</p>

<p>
This paper is a short summary of the subject, concentrating on the
enumerative and algebraic aspects but with an account of group-theoretic
properties. The first section gives an introduction to permutation groups
and to some of the more specific topics we require, and the second describes
the links to model theory and enumeration. We give a spread of examples,
describe results on the growth rate of the counting functions, discuss
a graded algebra associated with an oligomorphic group, and finally discuss
group-theoretic properties such as simplicity, the small index property, and
"almost-freeness".

Counting defective parking functions,

</p>

<p>
Suppose that <i>n</i> drivers each choose a preferred parking space in a linear
car park with <i>m</i> spaces. Each driver goes to the chosen space and parks
there if it is free, and otherwise takes the first available space with
larger number (if any). If all drivers park successfully, the sequence of
choices is called a parking function. In general, if <i>k</i> drivers fail to
park, we have a <i>defective parking function</i> of <i>defect</i> <i>k</i>. 
Let cp(<i>n,m,k</i>) be the number of such functions.
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we establish a recurrence relation for the numbers 
cp(<i>n,m,k</i>), and
express this as an equation for a three-variable generating function.
We solve this equation using the kernel method, and extract the coefficients
explicitly: it turns out that the cumulative totals are partial sums in
Abel's binomial identity. Finally, we compute the asymptotics of
cp(<i>n,m,k</i>). In particular, for the case <i>m=n</i>, if choices are made
independently at random, the limiting distribution
of the defect (the number of drivers who fail to park), scaled by the
square root of <i>n</i>, is the Rayleigh distribution. On the other hand, 
in case
<i>m</i>=omega(<i>n</i>), the probability that all
spaces are occupied tends asymptotically to one.

Cores of symmetric graphs</a>,

</p>

<p>
The core of a graph &Gamma; is the smallest graph &Delta; which is
homomorphically equivalent to &Gamma; (that is, there exist homomorphisms 
in both directions). The core of &Gamma; is unique up to isomorphism and 
is an induced subgraph of &Gamma;.
</p>

<p>
We give a construction in some sense dual to the core. The
<i>hull</i> of a graph &Gamma; is a graph containing &Gamma; as a
spanning subgraph, admitting all the endomorphisms of &Gamma;, and
having as core a complete graph of the same order as the core of
&Gamma;. This construction is related to the notion of a
synchronizing permutation group which arises in semigroup theory; we
provide some more insight by characterizing these permutation groups
in terms of graphs.
</p>

<p>
It is known that the core of a vertex-transitive graph is vertex-transitive.
In some cases we can make stronger statements: for example, if &Gamma;
is a nonedge-transitive graph, we show that either the core of &Gamma; is
complete, or &Gamma; is its own core.
</p>

<p>
Rank 3 graphs are nonedge-transitive. We examine some families of these to
decide which of the two alternatives for the core actually holds. We will see
that this question is very difficult, being equivalent in some cases to
unsolved questions in finite geometry (for example, about spreads, ovoids,
and partitions into ovoids in polar spaces).

A generalisation of <i>t</i>-designs</a>,

</p>

<p>
This paper defines a class of designs which generalise
<i>t</i>-designs, resolvable designs, and orthogonal arrays. For the parameters
<i>t</i>=2, <i>k</i>=3 and &lambda;=1, the designs in the class consist 
of Steiner triple systems, Latin squares, and 1-factorisations of complete 
graphs. For other values of <i>t</i> and <i>k</i>, we obtain <i>t</i>-designs,
Kirkman systems, large sets of Steiner triple systems, sets of mutually
orthogonal Latin squares, and (with a further generalisation) resolvable
2-designs and indeed much more general partitions of designs, as well
as orthogonal arrays over variable-length alphabets.
</p>

<p>
The Markov chain method of Jacobson and Matthews for choosing a random
Latin square extends naturally to Steiner triple systems and
1-factorisations of complete graphs, and indeed to
all designs in our class with <i>t</i>=2, <i>k</i>=3, and arbitrary
&lambda;, although little is known about its convergence or even its 
connectedness.

We discuss certain combinatorial and counting problems related to
quadratic algebras. First we confirm the Anick conjecture on the minimal
Hilbert series for algebras given by <i>n</i> generators and
<i>n</i>(</i>n</i>-1)/2 relations for <i>n</i>&le;7. Then we investigate
the combinatorial structure of the coloured graph associated with the
relations of an RIT algebra. Precise descriptions of graphs (maps)
corresponding to algebras with maximal Hilbert series are given in 
certain cases. As a consequence it turns out, for example, that an
RIT algebra may have a maximal Hilbert series only if the components
of the graph associated with each colour are pairwise 2-isomorphic.

<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a permutation group acting on a finite set <i>Omega</i>.
An <i>uncovering-by-bases</i> (or UBB) for <i>B</i> is a set <i>U</i> of
bases for <i>G</i> such that any <i>r</i>-subsets of <i>Omega</i> is
disjoint from at least one base in <i>U</i>, where
<i>r</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;[(<i>d</i>-1)/2], for <i>d</i> the minimum degree of
<i>G</i>. The <i>single-orbit conjecture</i> asserts that for any finite
permutation group <i>G</i> there exists a UBB for <i>G</i> contained in a
single orbit of <i>G</i> on its irredundant bases. We prove a case of this
conjecture, for when <i>G</i> is <i>k</i>-transitive and has a base of
size <i>k</i>+1. Furthermore, in the restricted case when <i>G</i> is
primitive and has a base of size <i>2</i>, we show how to construct a UBB
of minimum possible size.

Asymptotic enumeration of 2-covers and line graphs</a>,

<p>
In this paper we find asymptotic enumerations for the number of line graphs on

objects called 2-covers.
</p>

<p>
We find that the number of 2-covers, <i>s<sub>n</sub></i>, and proper 2-covers,

<blockquote>
<i>B</i><sub>2<i>n</i></sub>2<sup>-<i>n</i></sup>exp(-&#189;log(2<i>n</i>/log&nbsp;<i>n</i>))
</blockquote>
where <i>B</i><sub>2<i>n</i></sub> is the 2<i>n</i>-th Bell number,
while the number of restricted 2-covers, <i>u<sub>n</sub></i>,
restricted, proper 2-covers <i>v<sub>n</sub></i>, and line graphs
<i>l<sub>n</sub></i> all have growth
<blockquote>

We investigate the computational complexity of finding an element of a

distance to a given element <i>pi</i> in <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, for different
metrics on <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>. We assume that <i>H</i> is given by a

polynomial time by exhaustive enumeration. For the case of the Cayley
distance, this problem has been shown to be NP-hard, even if <i>H</i> is
abelian of exponent 2. We present a much simpler proof of this result,
which also works for the Hamming distance, the <i>l<sub>p</sub></i>
distance, Lee's distance, Kendall's tau, and Ulam's distance. Moreover,
we give an NP-hardness proof for the <i>l</i><sub>infty</sub> distance
using a different reduction idea. Finally, we settle the complexity of
the corresponding fixed-parameter and maximization problems.

the strict order, all five generalisations of homogeneity coincide,

The celebrated Urysohn space is the completion of a countable universal
homogeneous metric space which can itself be built as a direct limit of
finite metric spaces. It is our purpose in this paper to give another
example of a space constructed in this way, where the finite spaces are
scaled cubes. The resulting countable space provides a context for a
direct limit of finite symmetric groups with strictly diagonal embeddings,
acting naturally on a module which additively is the "Nim field" (the
quadratic closure of the field of order 2). Its completion is familiar in
another guise: it is the set of Lebesgue-measurable subsets of the unit
interval modulo null sets. We describe the isometry groups of these spaces
and some interesting subgroups, and give some generalisations and speculations.

We investigate the notion of quantum chromatic number of a graph, which
is the minimal number of colours necessary in a protocol in which two
separated provers can convince an interrogator with certainty that they
have a colouring of the graph.
</p>

<p>
After discussing this notion from first principles, we go on to establish
relations with the clique number and orthogonal representations of the
graph. We also prove several general facts about this graph parameter and
find large separations between the clique number and the quantum chromatic
number by looking at random graphs. Finally, we show that there can be no
separation between classical and quantum chromatic number if the latter
is 2, nor if it is 3 in a restricted quantum model; on the other hand we
exhibit a graph on 18 vertices and 44 edges with chromatic number 5 and
quantum chromatic number 4.

The subjects of the title are all connected. The purpose of this paper is
to explain the relation between <i>Sudoku solutions</i>
(filled Sudoku grids) and the more general
(and earlier) concept of <i>gerechte designs</i>, and to give some
examples of these. Constructing gerechte designs can be viewed as
finding resolutions of a block design constructed from the relevant grid.
We give an upper bound for the number of mutually orthogonal Sudoku solutions,
and a smaller upper bound if certain additional constraints are prescribed,
and show by a geometric construction using spreads (explicitly realised by
Hamming codes) that the bounds are attained. We generalise the bounds and
the constructions to other situations. We explain the statistical background
and construct a few Sudoku solutions with remarkable additional properties.
For one of these types, which we call "symmetric Sudoku solutions",
we give a construction,
and an elementary proof that there are just two inequivalent solutions;
the proofs are based on projective and affine geometry over GF(3) and
the properties of the Hamming code of length 4 over GF(3). We also
explain the statistical considerations behind gerechte designs, and
construct some Sudoku solutions which have good statistical properties.

A classification of incidence matrices is considered

were assumed to be finite. There were a few papers, and a set of lecture notes

the topic than can possibly be summarised in an article like this one.

I shall concentrate on a few topics, following the pattern of my conference
lectures: the random graph (a case study); homogeneous relational structures
(a powerful construction technique for interesting permutation groups);
oligomorphic permutation groups (where the relations with other areas such as
logic and combinatorics are clearest, and where a number of interesting
enumerative questions arise); and the Urysohn space (another case
study). I have preceded this with a short section introducing the language
of permutation group theory, and I conclude with briefer accounts of a
couple of topics that didn't make the cut for the lectures (maximal subgroups
of the symmetric group, and Jordan groups).

Orbit-counting polynomials for graphs and codes</a>,
<i>Discrete Math.</i> <b>308</b> (2008), 920-930.
</p>

<p>
We construct an "orbital Tutte polynomial" associated with a dual pair <i>M</i>
and <i>M</i>* of matrices over a principal ideal domain <i>R</i> 
and a group <i>G</i>
of automorphisms of the row spaces of the matrices. The polynomial has two
sequences of variables, each sequence indexed by associate classes of elements
of <i>R</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the case where <i>M</i> is the signed vertex-edge
incidence matrix of a graph &Gamma; over
the ring of integers, the orbital Tutte polynomial specialises to count
orbits of <i>G</i> on proper colourings of &Gamma; or on nowhere-zero 
flows or tensions on &Gamma; with values in an abelian group <i>A</i>.
(In the case of flows, for example, we must substitute for the variable
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>
the number of solutions of the equation <i>ia</i>=0 in the group <i>A</i>. 
In particular, unlike the case of counting nowhere-zero flows, the answer 
depends on the structure of <i>A</i>, not just on its order.)
</p>

<p>
In the case where <i>M</i> is the generator matrix of a linear code over 
GF(<i>q</i>), the orbital Tutte polynomial specialises to count orbits of 
<i>G</i> on words of given weight in <i>C</i> or its dual.

<p>
An old conjecture of Marusic, Jordan and Klin asserts that any finite
vertex-transitive graph has a non-trivial semiregular automorphism.
Marusic and Scapellato proved this for cubic graphs. For these
graphs, we make a stronger conjecture, to the effect that there is a
semiregular automorphism of order tending to infinity with <i>n</i>. 
We prove that there is one of order greater than 2.

Finite geometry and permutation groups: some polynomial links</a>,

</p>

<p>
Any set of points in a finite projective space PG(<i>n,q</i>) defines a matroid
which is representable over GF(<i>q</i>). The Tutte polynomial of the matroid is
a two-variable polynomial which includes a lot of numerical information about
the configuration of points. For example, it determines the weight enumerator
of the code associated with the point set, and hence the cardinalities of
hyperplane sections of the set.
</p>

<p>
Another polynomial used in enumeration is the cycle index of a permutation
group, which includes information about the number of orbits of the group on
various configurations. This is the subject of a well-developed theory.
</p>

<p>
The aim (not yet realised) of the research reported here is to combine the
Tutte polynomial of a matroid with the cycle index of any group acting on the
matroid to obtain a more general polynomial which tells us about the number
of orbits of the group on configurations counted by the Tutte polynomial.

A finite permutation group <i>G</i> on a linearly ordered set

be a <i>k</i>-min-wise independent group, <i>k</i>-MWI for short, if
Pr(min(pi(<i>X</i>))=pi(<i>x</i>))=1/|<i>X</i>| for every subset

that |<i>X</i>|&le;<i>k</i> and for every <i>x</i> in <i>X</i>. 
We are concerned with the
case of <i>k</i>-MWI groups for any linear order. Indeed, we prove that
a permutation group <i>G</i> is <i>k</i>-MWI with respect to any linear
order if and only if for every <i>h</i>&le;<i>k</i> and for every 
<i>h</i>-set <i>X</i>
the group <i>G<sub>X</sub></i> is transitive on <i>X</i>. Next we 
use this result to
deduce a complete classification of these groups for <i>k</i>&gt;2.

A tube (resp. an oval tube) in PG(3,<i>q</i>) is a pair

is a collection of mutually disjoint lines of PG(3,<i>q</i>) such that for 
each plane <i>pi</i> of PG(3,<i>q</i>) containing
L the intersection of <i>pi</i> with the lines of <i>L</i> is a hyperoval
(resp. an oval). The line L is called the axis of <i>T</i>. We show that
every tube for <i>q</i> even and every oval tube for <i>q</i> odd can be 
naturally embedded into a regular spread and hence admits a group of 
automorphisms which fixes every element of <i>T</i> and acts regularly on 
each of them. For <i>q</i> odd we obtain a classification of oval tubes up to
projective equivalence. Furthermore, we characterize the reguli in 
PG(3,<i>q</i>), for <i>q</i> odd, as oval tubes which admit more than one axis.

Crested products of association schemes</a>,
<i>J. London Math. Soc.</i> <b>72</b> (2005), 1-24.
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we define a new type of product of association schemes
(and of the related objects, permutation groups and orthogonal block
structures), which generalizes the direct and wreath products (which
are referred to as "crossing" and "nesting" in the statistical
literature.) Given two association schemes <i>Q<sub>r</sub></i> for 
<i>r</i>=1,2, each having an inherent partition <i>F<sub>r</sub></i> 
(that is, a partition whose equivalence relation is a union of adjacency 
relations in the association scheme), we define a product of the two 
schemes, which reduces to the direct product if 
<i>F</i><sub>1</sub>=<i>U</i><sub>1</sub> or
<i>F</i><sub>2</sub>=<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>, and to the wreath product if
<i>F</i><sub>1</sub>=<i>E</i><sub>1</sub> and 
<i>F</i><sub>2</sub>=<i>U</i><sub>2</sub>, where <i>E<sub>r</sub></i> and 
<I>U<sub>r</sub></i> are the relation of equality and the universal relation 
on <i>Q<sub>r</sub></i>. We calculate
the character table of the crested product, and show that if the two
schemes <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> have formal duals, then 
so does their crested product (and we give a simple description of this
dual). We make an analogous definition for permutation groups with
intransitive normal subgroups, and  show that the constructions for
association schemes and permutation groups are related in a natural way.
</p>

<p>
The definition can be generalized to association schemes with families of
inherent partitions, or permutation groups with families of intransitive
normal subgroups. This time the correspondence is not so straightforward,
and works as expected only if the inherent partitions (or orbit partitions)
form a distributive lattice.

<p>
We conclude with some open problems.

Orbit-homogeneity in permutation groups,
<i>J. London Math. Soc.</i> <b>38</b> (2006), 597-606.
</p>

<p>
We introduce the concept of orbit-homogeneity of permutation
groups: a group <i>G</i> is orbit <i>t</i>-homogeneous if two sets of
cardinality <i>t</i> lie in the same orbit of <i>G</i> whenever their
intersections with each <I>G</I>-orbit have the same cardinality. For
transitive groups, this coincides with the usual notion of
<i>t</i>-homogeneity. This concept is also compatible with the idea of
partition transitivity introduced by Martin and Sagan.
</p>

<p>
We show that any group generated by orbit <i>t</i>-homogeneous
subgroups is orbit <i>t</i>-homogeneous, and that the condition becomes
stronger as <i>t</i> increases up to [<i>n</i>/2], where <i>n</i> is
the degree. So any group <i>G</i> has a unique maximal orbit
<i>t</i>-homogeneous subgroup &Omega;<sub><i>t</i></sub>(<i>G</i>), and
&Omega;<sub><i>t</i></sub>(<i>G</i>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&Omega;<sub><i>t</i>&minus;1</sub>(<i>G</i>).
</p>

<p>
We also give some structural results for orbit <i>t</i>-homogeneous
groups and a number of examples.

<p>
We establish and comment on a surprising relationship between the
behaviour modulo a prime <i>p</i> of the number <i>s<sub>n</sub></i>(<i>G</i>) 
of index <i>n</i> subgroups in a group <i>G</i>, and that of the corresponding 
subgroup numbers for a subnormal subgroup of <i>p</i>-power index in <i>G</i>. 
One of the applications of this result presented here concerns the
explicit determination modulo <i>p</i> of <i>s<sub>n</sub></i>(<i>G</i>) in 
the case when <i>G</i> is the fundamental group of a finite graph of finite

Covering radius for sets of permutations</a>,
<i>Discrete Math.</i> <b>293</b> (2005), 91-109.
</p>

<p>
We study the covering radius of sets of permutations with respect to the
Hamming distance. Let <i>f</i>(<i>n,s</i>) be the smallest number 
<i>m</i> for which there is a set of <i>m</i> permutations in 
<i>S<sub>n</sub></i> 
with covering radius at most <i>n&minus;s</i>.  We study <i>f</i>(<i>n,s</i>) 
in the general case and also in the case when the set of
permutations forms a group.
</p>

<p>
We find <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>,1) exactly and bounds on <i>f</i>(<i>n,s</i>) for 
<i>s</i>&gt;1. For <i>s</i>=2, our
bounds are linear in <i>n</i>. This case relates to classical conjectures by
Ryser and Brualdi on transversals of Latin squares and to more recent work
by K&eacute;zdy and Snevily. We discuss a flaw in Derienko's published proof 
of Brualdi's conjecture. We also show that every latin square contains a set
of entries which meets each row and column exactly once while using no
symbol more than twice.
</p>

<p>
In the case where the permutations form a group, we give necessary and
sufficient conditions for the covering radius to be exactly <i>n</i>. If the
group is <i>t</i>-transitive, then its covering radius is at most 
<i>n&minus;t</i>, and we give a partial determination of groups meeting this
bound.
</p>

<p>
We give some results on the covering radius of specific groups. For
the group PGL(2,<i>q</i>), the question can be phrased in geometric terms,
concerning configurations in the Minkowski plane over GF(<i>q</i>) meeting
every generator once and every conic in at most <i>s</i> points, where <i>s</i>
is as small as possible.  We give an exact answer except in the case
where <i>q</i> is congruent to 1 mod 6.

We define and study a certain cohomological property of finite

(Proc. London Math. Soc. 40, 468-501) on
equations in finite groups. Hall's twisted version (loc. cit.,
Theorem 1.6) of Frobenius' theorem implies that each cyclic group
of prime power order is of Frobenius type. We show that this
property in fact pertains to every finite <i>p</i>-group.

Product action</a>,
<i>Discrete Math.</i> <b>308</b> (2008), 386-394.
</p>

<p>
This paper studies the cycle indices of products of permutation groups.
The main focus is on the product action of the direct product of
permutation groups. The number of orbits of the product on <I>n</I>-tuples is
trivial to compute from the numbers of orbits of the factors; on the other
hand, computing the cycle index of the product is more intricate.
Reconciling the two computations leads to some interesting questions about
substitutions in formal power series. We also discuss what happens for
infinite (oligomorphic) groups and give detailed examples. Finally, we
briefly turn our attention to generalised wreath products, which are a
common generalisation of both the direct product with the product action
and the wreath product with the imprimitive action.

Switching with more than two colours</a>,
<i>Europ. J. Combinatorics</i> <B>25</b> (2004), 169-177.
</p>

<p>
The operation of switching a finite graph was introduced by Seidel, in the
study of strongly regular graphs. We may conveniently regard a graph as being
a 2-colouring of a complete graph; then the extension to switching of an
<i>m</i>-coloured complete graph is easy to define. However, the situation
is very different. For <i>m</i>&gt;2, all <i>m</i>-coloured graphs lie in
the same switching class. However, there are still interesting things to
say, especially in the infinite case.
</p>

<p>
This paper presents the basic theory of switching with more than two colours.
In the finite case, all graphs on a given set of vertices are equivalent
under switching, and we determine the structure of the switching group and
show that its extension by the symmetric group on the vertex set is primitive.
</p>

<p>
In the infinite case, there is more than one switching class; we determine
all those for which the group of switching automorphisms is the symmetric
group. We also exhibit some other cases (including the random <I>m</I>-coloured
complete graph) where the group of switching-automorphisms is highly
transitive.
</p>

<p>
Finally we consider briefly the case where not all switchings are allowed.
For convenience, we suppose that there are three colours of which two may be
switched. We show that, in the case of almost all finite random graphs, the
analogue of the bijection between switching classes and two-graphs holds.

<b>9(1)</B> (2002), #N2 (10pp).

<p>
With every linear code is associated a permutation group whose cycle index is
the weight enumerator of the code (up to normalisation).
</p>

<p>
There is a class of permutation groups
(the <i>IBIS groups</i>) which includes the groups obtained from codes as
above. With every IBIS group is associated a matroid; in the case of a code
group, the matroid differs only trivially from that which arises from the
code. In this case, the Tutte polynomial of the code specialises to the
weight enumerator (by Greene's Theorem), and hence also to the cycle index.
However, in another subclass of IBIS groups, the <i>base-transitive groups</i>,
the Tutte polynomial can be derived from the cycle index but not
vice versa.
</p>

<p>
I propose a polynomial for IBIS groups which generalises both Tutte polynomial
and cycle index.

<i> Discrete Math.</i>
<b>273</b> (2003), 101-112.
</p>

<p>
Strongly regular graphs lie on the cusp between highly structured and
unstructured. For example, there is a unique strongly regular graph with
parameters (36,10,4,2), but there are 32548 non-isomorphic graphs with
parameters (36,15,6,6). (The first assertion is a special case of a
theorem of Shrikhande, while the second is the result of a
computer search by McKay and Spence.) In the light of this,
it will be difficult to develop a theory of random strongly regular graphs!
</p>

<p>
For certain values of the parameters, we have at least one prerequisite for a
theory of random objects: there should be very many of them (e.g.
superexponentially many). Two other features we would like are a method to
sample from the uniform distribution (this is known in a couple of special
cases) and information about how various graph parameters behave as random
variables on the uniform distribution. Very little is known but there are a
few recent results and some interesting problems.
</p>

<p>
This paper develops no general theory, but explores a few examples and
techniques which can be applied in some cases.
</p>

<p>
Thomason has developed a theory of "pseudo-random graphs" which he calls
(<i>p</i>,&alpha;)-jumbled graphs. Some of these graphs are strongly regular,
but they are very special strongly regular graphs. I conclude with some
speculation about "random jumbled graphs".

that exclude such anomalous structures. In particular, we expect a design
to be regular, the complement of a design to be a design, and a
<i>t</i>-design to be an <i>s</i> design for all 
<i>s</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>t</i>.
These are all properties that can be taken for granted with finite designs,
and for infinite Steiner systems. We present a new definition of an
infinite <i>t</i>-design, and give examples of structures that satisfy
this definition. We note that infinite designs considered in the
literature to date satisfy our definition. We show that infinite design
theory does not always mirror finite design theory; for example, there
are designs with <i>v</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>b</i>.

<em>Coherent configurations</em> are combinatorial objects invented for the
purpose of studying finite permutation groups; every permutation group which
is not doubly transitive preserves a non-trivial coherent configuration.
However, symmetric coherent configurations have a much longer history, having
been used in statistics under the name of <em>association schemes</em>.
</p>

<p>
The relationship between permutation groups and association schemes is
quite subtle; there are groups which preserve no non-trivial association
scheme, and other groups for which there is not a unique minimal association
scheme.

</p>

<p>
Every permutation group which is not 2-transitive acts on a nontrivial
coherent configuration, but the question of which permutation groups <i>G</i>
act on nontrivial association schemes (symmetric coherent configurations) is
considerably more subtle. A closely related question is: when is there a
unique minimal <i>G</i>-invariant association scheme? We examine these 
questions, and relate them to more familiar concepts of permutation group 
theory (such as generous transitivity) and association scheme theory (such as 
stratifiability).
</p>

<p>
Our main results are the determination of all regular groups having a unique
minimal association scheme, and a classification of groups with no
non-trivial association scheme. The latter must be primitive, and are either
2-homogeneous, almost simple, or of diagonal type. The diagonal groups have
some very interesting features, and we examine them further. Among other
things we show that a diagonal group with non-abelian base group cannot be
stratifiable if it has ten or more factors, or generously transitive if it
has nine or more; and we characterise the quaternion group <i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>
as the unique non-abelian group <i>T</i> such that a diagonal group with eight 
factors <i>T</i> is generously transitive.

A graph is <i>n</i>-e.c. (<i>n</i>-existentially closed) if for every pair
of subsets <i>U</i>, <i>W</i> of the vertex set <i>V</i> of the graph
such that <i>U</i> and <i>W</i> are disjoint and

no edges between <i>v</i> and <i>W</i> are present. A graph is strongly regular
if it is a regular graph such that the number of

The only strongly regular graphs that are known to be <i>n</i>-e.c. for large

Recently D. G. Fon-Der-Flaass has found prolific
constructions of strongly regular graphs using affine designs.
He notes that some of these constructions were also studied by Wallis.
By taking the affine designs
to be Hadamard designs obtained from
Paley tournaments, we use probabilistic methods to show that many

Some infinite families of systems of linked symmetric designs

The smallest of these systems was used by Preece and Cameron to

This paper is a survey of some combinatorial problems related
to permutations and permutation groups. It is inspired by the
work of Paul Erd&#337;s in two ways. One one hand, I present some
partial extensions of the seminal work of Erd&#337;s and Tur&aacute;n
on random permutations, to groups other than the symmetric group.
On the other, many of the topics considered can be regarded as
analogues for sets of permutations of results on set-systems (or
hypergraphs) springing from the Erd&#337;s-Ko-Rado theorem.
</p>

<p>
I begin with the celebrated Orbit-Counting Lemma, and a generalisation
which connect orbits of a group on <i>n</i>-tuples with the probability
generating function for fixed points of its elements. Various results
and problems on derangements (fixed-point-free elements) are also given.
In the next section, I turn from fixed points to cycles. Observing that
the cycle index is the probability generating function for cycle structure,
we recover the earlier theorem, as well as a recent result of Parker.
Next I survey some extremal results for sets or groups of
permutations with prescribed distances (distance being defined
in terms of fixed points). After a brief discussion of the semilattice
of subpermutations (partial permutations), I conclude with a
concept to replace that of "random permutation" in the infinite
case: for countable sets, there is a unique such object (this is
the analogue of the Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi theorem on the countable
random graph).

<p>
We can use the compositional semantics of Hodges
to show that any compositional semantics for
logics of imperfect information must obey certain
constraints on the number of semantically inequivalent
formulas.  As a corollary, there is no compositional
semantics for the "independence-friendly" logic of
Hintikka and Sandu (henceforth IF) in which the
interpretation in a structure <i>A</i> of each 1-ary formula
is a subset of the domain of <i>A</i> (Corollary 14
proves this and more).  After a fashion, this
rescues a claim of Hintikka and provides the proof which
he lacked:
<blockquote>
&hellip; there is no realistic hope of formulating
compositional truth-conditions for [sentences of IF],
even though I have not given a strict impossibility proof
to that effect.
</blockquote>
One curious spinoff
is that there is a structure of cardinality 6 on which
the logic of Hintikka and Sandu gives nearly
eight million inequivalent formulas in one free variable
(which is more than the population of Finland).

Automorphisms and enumeration of switching classes of tournaments,
<a href=http://www.combinatorics.org><I>Electronic J. Combinatorics</i></a>
<b>7</b>(1) (2000), article #R38.
</p>

<p>
Two tournaments <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> on the same
vertex set <i>X</i> are said to be <em>switching equivalent</em> if
<i>X</i> has a subset <i>Y</i> such that <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> arises from
<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> by switching all arcs between <i>Y</i> and
its complement in <i>X</i>.  
</p>

<p>
The main result of this paper is a characterisation
of the abstract finite groups which are full automorphism groups of
switching classes of tournaments: they are those whose Sylow 2-subgroups
are cyclic or dihedral.  Moreover, if <i>G</i> is such a group,
then there is a switching class <i>C</i>, with
Aut(<i>C</i>) isomorphic to <i>G</i>, such that every subgroup of
<i>G</i> of odd order is the full
automorphism group of some tournament in <i>C</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Unlike previous results of this type, we do not give an explicit
construction, but only an existence proof. The proof follows as a
special case of a result on the full automorphism group of random
<i>G</i>-invariant digraphs selected from a certain class of probability
distributions.
</p>

<p>
We also show that a permutation group <i>G</i>, acting on a set <i>X</i>,
is contained in the automorphism group of some switching class
of tournaments with vertex set <i>X</i> if and only if the Sylow 2-subgroups
of <i>G</i> are cyclic or dihedral and act semiregularly on <i>X</i>.
Applying this result to individual permutations leads to
an enumeration of switching classes, of switching classes admitting odd
permutations, and of tournaments in a switching class.
</p>

<p>
We conclude by remarking that both the class of switching classes
of finite tournaments, and the class of "local orders" (that is,
tournaments switching-equivalent to linear orders), give rise to
countably infinite structures with interesting autmorphism groups
(by a theorem of Fra&iuml;ss&eacute;).

With any permutation group <i>G</i> on an infinite set &Omega; is
associated a graded algebra <i>A<sup>G</sup></i> (the algebra of
<i>G</i>-invariants in the reduced incidence algebra of finite subsets of 
&Omega;).  The dimension of the n-th homogeneous component of 
<i>A<sup>G</sup></i> is equal
to the number of orbits of <i>G</i> on <i>n</i>-subsets of &Omega;. If it
happens that <i>G</i> is the automorphism group of a homogeneous
structure <i>M</i>, then this is the number of unlabelled <i>n</i>-element
substructures of <i>M</i>. Many combinatorial enumeration problems fit
into this framework.
</p>

<p>
I conjectured 20 years ago that, if <i>G</i> has no finite orbits on
&Omega;, then <i>A<sup>G</sup></i> is an integral domain (and even has the
stronger property that a specific quotient is an integral domain).
I shall say that <i>G</i> is entire if <i>A<sup>G</sup></i> is an
integral domain, and strongly entire if the stronger property holds.
These properties have (rather subtle) consequences for the enumeration problems.
The conjecture is still open; but in this paper I prove that, if <i>G</i> is
transitive on &Omega; and the point stabiliser <i>H</i> is (strongly)
entire, then <i>G</i> is (strongly) entire.

Kerdock codes and extremal line-sets in 
<b>R</b><sup>2<sup><i>m</i>+1></sup></sup> with prescribed angles. Spreads in a 
2<i>m</i>-dimensional binary symplectic vector space  are related to
Kerdock codes over <b>Z</b><sub>4</sub> and extremal line-sets in
<b>C</b><sup>2<sup><i>m</i></sup></sup> with
prescribed angles. These connections involve binary, real and
complex geometry associated with  extraspecial 2-groups.
A geometric map from symplectic to orthogonal spreads is shown to
induce the Gray map from a corresponding <b>Z</b><sub>4</sub>-Kerdock
code to its binary image. These geometric considerations lead to the
construction of <i>d</i>(<i>m</i>)&minus;1 inequivalent

<b>Z</b><sub>4</sub>-linear
Preparata codes of length 2<sup><i>m</i></sup> for any
odd <i>m</i>, where <i>d</i>(<i>m</i>) denotes the number of divisors of

A permutation group is cofinitary if any
non-identity element fixes only finitely many points. 
In this article, I discuss two aspects of the theory
of cofinitary permutation groups, one topological, the
other combinatorial. Several open problems are included.

Studying the geometry of a group <i>G</i> leads us to questions
about its maximal subgroups and primitive permutation
representations (the <i>G</i>-invariant relations and similar
structures, the base size, recognition problems, and so on).
Taking the point of view that finite projective geometry
is the geometry of the groups PGL(<i>n,q</i>), Aschbacher's
theorem gives us eight natural families of geometric objects,
with greater or smaller degrees of familiarity. This paper
presents some speculations on how the subject could develop
from this point of view.

These notes are, in a sense, an elaboration
on the comments on pages 232-234 of the book
on Distance-transitive Graphs by Brouwer,
Cohen and Neumaier. Apart from these brief
comments, the book is exclusively concerned
with finite graphs. Many of these finite graphs
are geometrically defined, and involve a finite
field and sometimes a finite dimension. By
allowing one or both of these parameters to be
infinite, we often obtain infinite distance-transitive
graphs. However, entirely new phenomena occur in
the infinite case, which have no finite analogues.
</p>

<p>
In these notes, I discuss infinite graphs (and
other structures) with a large amount of symmetry. 
The discussion concentrates on the purely infinite 
phenomena, though we glance briefly at the infinite
versions of finite graphs. The celebrated "random graph" 
is typical of the new situation; the first section 
summarises some of the remarkable properties of this 
graph. Following this, we survey some basic material 
from permutation groups and model theory.  Then we 
discuss various constructions and characterisations 
of infinite highly symmetric graphs, and connections 
with several topics in finite combinatorics, including 
random graphs, enumeration, and graph reconstruction.

This chapter concerns some connections between

introduction to first-order logic and a discussion 
of which graph properties are first-order, we 
consider various logical concepts such as 
aleph_0-categoricity and homogeneity for graphs, 
and present a couple of theorems about finite graphs 
requiring logical techniques in their proofs. The 
chapter concludes with a discussion of a recent 
construction method due to Hrushovski related to 
sparse random graphs.

In this chapter, the connections between a graph
and its automorphism group are described. The main 
themes are that most graphs have very little 
symmetry; abstract automorphism groups can be
prescribed independently of most graph-theoretic 
properties; vertex-transitivity, however, entails 
various structural properties; and still higher 
degrees of symmetry can be expected to lead to a 
complete classification.

The main theme of this paper is that counting orbits of an 
infinite permutation group on finite subsets or tuples is 
very closely related to combinatorial enumeration. This point 
of view ties together various disparate "stories", concerning
two-graphs, circular orders, Stirling numbers, series-reduced
trees, etc.

There is a natural topology on the symmetric group
on an infinite set Omega. If Omega is countable, 
the topology is derived from a metric, and the group 
is complete. This paper gives an account of this topology,
including translations of topological concepts for 
permutation groups, the use of Baire category and 
Haar measure, and some results about cofinitary
permutation groups which are motivated by the 
combinatorics of finite symmetric groups.

A finite permutation group is cycle-closed if it 
contains all the cycles of all of its elements. 
It is shown by elementary means that the cycle-closed 
groups are precisely the direct products of symmetric
groups and cyclic groups of prime order. Moreover, 
from any group, a cycle-closed group is reached in 
at most three steps, a step consisting of adding all 
cycles of all group elements. For infinite groups, there
are several possible generalisations. Some analogues 
of the finite result are proved.

A permutation group is cofinitary if any non-identity 
element fixes only finitely many points. This paper 
presents a survey of such groups. The paper has 
four parts. Sections 1-5 develop some basic theory, 
concerning groups with finite orbits, topology,
maximality, and normal subgroups. Sections 6-10 give 
a variety of constructions, both direct and from 
geometry, combinatorial group theory, trees, and 
homogeneous relational structures. Sections 11-15 
present some generalisations of sharply k-transitive
groups, including an orbit-counting result with a 
character-theoretic flavour. The final section treats 
some miscellaneous topics. Several open problems 
are mentioned.

This note is inspired by the paper <i>Some Canonical 
Sequences of Integers</i> by Bernstein and Sloane. 
The main observation is that seven of the operators 
defined in that paper have natural interpretations 
in terms of counting orbits of groups, providing 
a pattern which is completed by five further 
operators. Some of their eigen-sequences also have
group-theoretic meaning.

<p>
In this paper, we give two equivalent conditions for the
irredundant bases of a permutation group to be the bases 
of a matroid. (These are deduced from a more general 
result on families of sets.) If they hold, then the 
group acts geometrically on the matroid, in the sense
that the fixed points of any element form a flat. Some 
partial results towards a classification of such 
permutation groups are given. Further, if G acts 
geometrically on a perfect matroid design, there is a 
formula for the number of G-orbits on bases in terms of 
the cardinalities of flats and the numbers of <i>G</i>-orbits 
on tuples. This reduces, in a particular case, to the 
inversion formula for Stirling numbers.
