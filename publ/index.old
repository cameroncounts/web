<li> (with Jo&atilde;o Ara&uacute;jo) Primitive groups synchronize non-uniform
maps of extreme ranks, <em>J. Combinatorial Theory</em> (B);

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Let &Omega; be a set of cardinality <i>n</i>,
<i>G</i> a permutation group on &Omega;, and <i>f</i>:&Omega;&rarr;&Omega;
a map which is not a permutation. We say that <i>G</i> synchronizes <i>f</i>
if the semigroup &lang;<i>G,f</i>&rang; contains a constant map.
</p><p>
The first author has conjectured that a primitive group synchronizes
any map whose kernel is non-uniform. Rystsov proved one instance of this
conjecture, namely, degree <i>n</i>  primitive groups synchronize maps of
rank <i>n</i>&minus;1 (thus, maps with kernel type (2,1,&hellip;,1)). We
prove some extensions of Rystsov's result, including this: a primitive group
synchronizes every map whose kernel type is (<i>k</i>,1,&hellip;,1).
Incidentally this result provides a new characterization of imprimitive groups.
 We also  prove that  the conjecture above holds for maps of extreme ranks,
that is, ranks 3, 4 and <i>n</i>&minus;2.
</p><p>
These proofs use a graph-theoretic
technique due to the second author: a transformation semigroup fails to
contain a constant map if and only if it is contained in the endomorphism
semigroup of a non-null (simple undirected) graph.
</p><p>
The paper finishes with a number of open problems, whose solutions will certainly require very delicate graph theoretical considerations.

semigroups: results and problems, Proceedings of Groups St Andrews 2013; arXiv
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3585">1308.3585</a>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> J.M. Howie, the influential St Andrews 
semigroupist, claimed that we value an area of pure mathematics to the
extent that (a) it gives rise to arguments that are deep and elegant, and
(b) it has interesting interconnections with other parts of pure mathematics.
</p><p>
This paper surveys some recent results on the transformation semigroup
generated by a permutation group <i>G</i> and a single non-permutation <i>a</i>.
Our particular concern is the influence that properties of <i>G</i> (related to
homogeneity, transitivity and primitivity) have on the structure of the
semigroup. In the first part of the paper, we consider properties of
<i>S</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;<i>G,a</i>&rang; such as regularity and idempotent
generation. The second
is a brief report on the synchronization project, which aims to decide
in what circumstances <i>S</i> contains an element of rank&nbsp;1. The paper
closes with a list of open problems on permutation groups and linear groups,
and some comments about the impact on semigroups are provided.
</p><p>
These two research directions outlined above lead to very interesting and
challenging problems on primitive permutation groups whose solutions require
combining results from several different areas of mathematics, certainly
fulfilling both of Howie's elegance and value tests in a new and fascinating
way.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b>
Let <i>X</i> be a finite set such that |<i>X</i>|&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>n</i> and let <i>i</i>&le;<i>j</i>&le;<i>n</i>. A group <i>G</i>&le;<i>S<sub>n</sub></i> is said to be (<i>i,j</i>)-homogeneous if for every <i>I,J</i>&sube;<i>X</i>, such that |<i>I</i>|=<i>i</i> and |<i>J</i>|=<i>j</i>, there exists <i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i> such that <i>Ig</i>&sube;<i>J</i>. (Clearly (<i>i,i</i>)-homogeneity is <i>i</i>-homogeneity in the usual sense.)
</p>
<p>
A group <i>G</i>&le;<i>S<sub>n</sub></i> is said to have the <i>k</i>-universal transversal property if given any set <i>I</i>&sube;<i>X</i> (with |<i>I</i>|=<i>k</i>) and any partition <i>P</i> of <i>X</i> into <i>k</i> blocks, there exists <i>g</i>&isin;<i>G</i> such that <i>Ig</i> is a section for <i>P</i>. (That is, the orbit of each <i>k</i>-subset of <i>X</i> contains a section for each <i>k</i>-partition of <i>X</i>.)
</p>
<p>
In this paper we classify the groups with the <i>k</i>-universal transversal property (with the exception of two classes of 2-homogeneous groups) and the (<i>k</i>&minus;1,<i>k</i>)-homogeneous groups (for 2&lt;<i>k</i>&le;&lfloor;(<i>n</i>+1/2&rfloor;). As a corollary of the classification we prove that a (<i>k</i>&minus;1,<i>k</i>)-homogeneous group is also (<i>k</i>&minus;2,<i>k</i>&minus;1)-homogeneous, with two exceptions; and similarly, but with no exceptions, groups having the <i>k</i>-universal transversal property have the (<i>k</i>&minus;1)-universal transversal property.
</p>
<p>
A corollary of all the previous results is a  classification of  the groups that together with any rank <i>k</i> transformation on <i>X</i> generate a regular semigroup (for 1&le;<i>k</i>&le;&lfloor;(<i>n</i>+1/2)&rfloor;).
</p>
<p>
The paper ends with a number of challenges for experts in number theory, group and/or semigroup theory, linear algebra and matrix theory.

<li> (with Joshua M. Browning and Ian M. Wanless) Bounds on the number of
small Latin subsquares,
<em>J. Combinatorial Theory</em> (A) <b>124</b> (2014), 41-56; 
doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2014.01.002">10.1016/j.jcta.2014.01.002</a>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b>
Let &zeta;(<i>n,m</i>) be the largest number of order <i>m</i> subsquares achieved by any Latin square of order <i>n</i>. We show that &zeta;(<i>n,m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) if <i>m</i>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{2,3,5} and &zeta;(<i>n,m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>) if <i>m</i>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{4,6,9,10}. In particular, (1/8)<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>+O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&zeta;(<i>n</i>,2)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;(1/4)<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>+O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) and (1/27)<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>+O(<i>n</i><sup>5/2</sup>)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&zeta;(<i>n</i>,3)&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;(1/18)<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>+O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) for all <i>n</i>. We find an explicit bound on &zeta;(<i>n</i>,2<sup><i>d</i></sup>) of the form &Theta;(<i>n</i><sup><i>d</i>+2</sup>) and which is achieved only by elementary abelian 2-groups.
</p>
<p>
For a fixed Latin square <i>L</i> let &zeta;*(<i>n,L</i>) be the largest number of subsquares isotopic to <i>L</i> achieved by any Latin square of order <i>n</i>. When <i>L</i> is a cyclic Latin square we show that &zeta;*(<i>n,L</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Theta;(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>). For a large class of Latin squares <i>L</i> we show that &zeta;*(<i>n,L</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;O(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>). For any Latin square <i>L</i> we give an &epsilon; in the interval (0,1) such that &zeta;*(<i>n,L</i>)&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&Omega;(<i>n</i><sup>2+&epsilon;</sup>). We belive that this bound is achieved for certain squares <i>L</i>.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b>
From time to time machines stop obeying. This happened in the fictional case of HAL, the computer in the movie <em>2001 &ndash; a Space Odyssey</em>, but it is a real issue in many different  daily situations. In such circumstances we want to have an option that brings the machine to a known initial state, irrespective of its current state. Many machines admit some kind of a <em>ctrl+alt+del</em> approach, and, ultimately, a powered machine  can be unplugged and restarted. However, not all machines can be unplugged  and, for those, the alternative <em>ctrl+alt+del</em> approach can be far from obvious. For example, in the 2001 issue of <em>Nature</em>, Benenson, Paz-Elizur, Adar, Keinen, Livneh and Shapiro introduced a programmable and autonomous computing machine made out of biomolecules. Quite obviously, such systems cannot be <em>unplugged</em>. How can they be brought to a known initial state irrespective of their current state?
</p>
<p>
"Lack of obedience" can also be noticed on general processes, that is, on any situation that can be modeled  by an automaton. Hence it comes as no surprise that the general need of "bringing the process to a known initial state, irrespective of its current state" is omnipresent. For example, batteries may be dropped unoriented on a conveyer belt, and we want to establish a process guaranteeing that all the batteries appear oriented in the end; that is, irrespective of the initial orientation of the batteries, in the end they are all in the same (oriented) state. Another example is a satellite going behind the Moon (where it escapes our control): when it reappears we want to regain control over it, irrespective of its current situation (position, orientation, etc). Yet another example is the concept of <em>self-stabilization</em> introduced by Dijkstra in 1974.  In all such cases there is no "unplug" solution. What we really need is a sequence of instructions so that the process is brought to a known state. In automata theory such a sequence of instructions, that ends up in the same state irrespective of the state it starts in, is called a <em>reset</em> (or <em>synchronizing</em>) word. Not all automata have a synchronizing word; in addition, when they have one, they have many, and hence it is desirable to find the smallest one. These two problems (classify the automata admitting a synchronizing word and bound the length of a synchronizing word &ndash; conjectured to be (<i>n</i>&minus;1)<sup>2</sup>, for an <i>n</i>-state finite deterministic automaton &ndash;) are among the oldest and most important problems in automata theory.
</p>
<p>
Recently, we saw the completion of one of the greatest research projects ever carried out, leading to the proof of the so called <em>Enormous Theorem</em>: the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG). This theorem was the result of the combined work of more than one hundred outstanding mathematicians for more than fifty years. The importance of this result is that it provides an extremely powerful tool to successfully attack problems thought hopeless not long ago.
</p><p>
One of the goals of this paper is to open a new trend  of applications of the Enormous Theorem to the synchronization problem. We use some deep results on groups and combinatorics, along with CFSG, to provide infinite families of automata admitting a synchronizing word.
</p><p>
 The paper ends with a number of problems on synchronization likely  to attract the attention of experts in computer science, combinatorics and geometry, groups and semigroups, linear algebra and matrix theory, thus highlighting the unifying nature of the synchronization problem, and the progresses it will require from  these various branches of mathematics and computer science.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b>
A transformation monoid on a set &Omega; is called <em>synchronizing</em> if
it contains an element of rank 1 (that is, mapping the whole of &Omega;
to a single point). In this paper, I tackle the question: given <i>n</i> and
<i>k</i>, what is the probability that the submonoid of the full transformation
monoid <i>T<sub>n</sub></i> generated by <i>k</i> random transformations is
synchronizing?
</p>
<p>
The question has some similarities with a similar question about the probability
that the subgroup of <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> generated by <i>k</i> random
permutations is transitive. For <i>k</i>=1, the answer is 1/<i>n</i>; for
<i>k</i>=2, Dixon's Theorem asserts that it is 1-o(1) as <i>n</i>&rarr;&infin;
(and good estimates are now known). For our synchronization question, for
<i>k</i>=1 the answer is also 1/<i>n</i>; I conjecture
that for <i>k</i>=2 it is also 1-o(1).
</p>
<p>
Following the technique of Dixon's theorem, we need to analyse the maximal
non-synchronizing submonoids of <i>T<sub>n</sub></i>. I develop a very close
connection
between transformation monoids and graphs, from which we obtain a description
of non-synchronizing monoids as endomorphism monoids of graphs satisfying some
very strong conditions. However, counting such graphs,
and dealing with the intersections of their endomorphism monoids, seems
difficult.

<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b>
This paper introduces combinatorial representations, which generalise the
notion of linear representations of matroids. We show that any family of
subsets of the same cardinality has a combinatorial representation via
matrices. We then prove that any graph is representable over all alphabets
of size larger than some number depending on the graph. We also provide a
characterisation of families representable over a given alphabet. Then, we
associate a rank function and a rank operator to any representation which
help us determine some criteria for the functions used in a representation.
While linearly representable matroids can be viewed as having representations
via matrices with only one row, we conclude this paper by an investigation of
representations via matrices with only two rows.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b>
A statistician designing an experiment wants to get as much information as
possible from the data gathered. Often this means the most precise estimate
possible (that is, an estimate with minimum possible variance) of the
unknown parameters. If there are several parameters, this can be interpreted
in many ways: do we want to minimize the average variance, or the maximum
variance, or the volume of a confidence region for the parameters?
</p>
<p>
In the case of block designs, these optimality criteria can be calculated
from the concurrence graph of the design, and in many cases from its
Laplacian eigenvalues.  The Levi graph can also be used.
The various criteria turn out to be closely connected
with other properties of the graph as a network, such as number of spanning
trees, isoperimetric number, and the sum of the resistances between pairs
of vertices when the graph
is regarded as an electrical network.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, we discuss the notions of optimality for incomplete-block
designs, explain the graph-theoretic connections, and prove some old and new
results about optimality.
