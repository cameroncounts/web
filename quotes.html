This collection is a miscellany in Littlewood&#8217;s sense (see his definition under <a href="#misc">Miscellany</a> below). The quotes are almost all derived from my own reading, though a few are culled from dictionaries or have been sent to me by others. I have organised them under several headings (see above) with a few cross-links. I have also tried to put similar or complementary quotes together, so if you are led to one quote, scan the others around it. (See the pair by Noam Chomsky and Thetis Blacker, towards the end of Miscellany, those by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and Robert Louis Stevenson, and  those by Hermann Hesse and G. K. Chesterton, both pairs also in Miscellany, those by Dante Alighieri and Nicole Oresme at the start of Probability and Statistics, or the three quotes on mathematics and conjuring or astrology at the end of History, for example.)

<dt>mathematicks</dt>
<dd> That science which contemplates whatever is capable of being numbered or measured; and it is either pure or mixt: pure considers abstracted quantity, without any relation to matter; mixt is interwoven with physical considerations.</dd>
<dt>logick</dt>
<dd> The art of reasoning.</dd>
<dt>arithmetick</p>
<dt>
<dd> The science of numbers; the art of computation.</dd>
<dt>algebra</dt>
<dd>This is a peculiar kind of arithmetick, which takes the quantity sought, whether it be a number or a line, or any other quantity, as if it were granted, and by means of one or more quantities given, proceeds by consequence, till the quantity at first only supposed to be known, or at least some power thereof, is found to be equal to some quantity or quantities which are known, and consequently itself is known.</dd>
<dt>geometry</dt>
<dd> Originally signifies the art of measuring the earth, or any distances or dimensions on or within it: but it is now used for the science of quantity, extension, or magnitude abstractedly considered, without any regard to matter.</dd>
<dt>trigonometry</dt>
<dd> Trigonometry is the art of measuring triangles, or of calculating the sides of any triangle sought, and this is plane or spherical.</dd>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd> The species of quantity by which it is computed how many.<br />
[eight other meanings]</dd>
<dt>differential method</p>
<dt>
<dd>is applied to the doctrine of infinitesimals, or infinitely small quantities, called the arithmetick of fluxions; about the invention of which there has been a contest between Leibnitz and Sir Isaac Newton. It consists in descending from whole quantities to their infinitely small differences, and comparing together these infinitely small differences, of what kind soever they be: and from thence it takes the name of the differential calculus, or analysis of infinitesimals.</dd>

<dd> Arabick words, which are used to imply the six operations of arithmetick, or the science of numbers.</dd>
<dt>mechanicks</dt>
<dd> Dr. Wallis defines mechanicks to be the geometry of motion, a mathematical science, which shews the effects of powers, or moving forces, so far as they are applied to engines, and demonstrates the laws of motion.</dd>

I found, that in Germany they were engaged in a species of political enquiry, to which they had given the name of Statistics; though I apply a different idea to that word, for by Statistics is meant in Germany, an inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the political strength of a country, or questions respecting matters of state; whereas, the idea I annex to the term, is an inquiry into the state of a country, for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement.

A fine collection of quotations about proof in mathematics, assembled by David Lingard, appears in the <i>BSHM Bulletin</i> <b>1</b> (2004), 63–66. I can&#8217;t find them on the Web, but here, as a sample, are two conflicting views from Riemann and Gauss, quoted by Imre Lakatos in <i>Proofs and Refutations</i>:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">
Georg Bernhard Riemann: &#8220;If only I had the theorems! Then I should find the proofs easily enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">
Karl Friedrich Gauss: &#8220;I have had my results for a long time, but I do not yet know how to arrive at them.&#8221;

The reason that mathematics invented the idea of proof and made it the criterion for belief is that human intuition has so often proved faulty. Widely believed conjectures sometimes turn out to be false.

A non-symbolic argument or proof can be quite rigorous when given for a particular value of the variable; the conditions for rigor are that the particular value of the variable should be typical, and that a further generalization to any value should be immediate.

Manin describes the act of acceptance as a social act: however, the importance of its personal, psychological component can hardly be overestimated.

The [isoperimetric] problem had occurred to the Greek geometers of over 2000 years ago but its solution was not discovered until the 1880s. This solution, which is that the curve must be a circle, was known to the Greeks, but it is one thing to know what the solution of a problem is and quite another to establish this solution in an adequately convincing form or, as we say, to prove it mathematically.

I think it is said that Gauss had ten different proofs for the law of quadratic reciprocity. Any good theorem should have several proofs, the more the better. For two reasons: usually, different proofs have different strengths and weaknesses, and they generalise in different directions — they are not just repetitions of each other.

Mathematics, however, is, as it were, its own explanation; this, although it may seem hard to accept, is nevertheless true, for the recognition that a fact is so is the cause upon which we base the proof.

Lefschetz valued independent thinking and originality above everything. He was, in fact, contemptuous of elegant or rigorous proofs of what he considered obvious points. He once dismissed a clever new proof of one of this theorems by saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t come to me with your pretty proofs. We don&#8217;t bother with that baby stuff around here.&#8221; Legend had it that he never wrote a correct proof or stated an incorrect theorem. His first comprehensive treatise on topology, a highly influential book in which he coined the term &#8220;algebraic topology,&#8221; &#8220;hardly contains one completely correct proof. It was rumored that it had been written during one of Lefschetz&#8217; sabbaticals … when his students did not have the opportunity to revise it.&#8221;

The proof [of the existence of an infinity of prime numbers] is by <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, and <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician&#8217;s favourite weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers <i>the game</i>.

[Christopher] Hansteen declared that proofs should not be used in elementary teaching before it was necessary because, he argued, it invited students to memorize without understanding. To this, [Michael] Holmboe replied that one either has to prove all or nothing, as half a proof is worse than no proof.

<h2>Axioms</h2>
<p></a></p>
<p>
A choice of axioms is not purely a subjective task. It is usually expected to achieve some definite aim — some specific theorem or theorems are to be derivable from the axioms — and to this extent the problem is exact and objective. But beyond this there are always other important desiderata of a less exact nature: the axioms should not be too numerous, their system is to be as simple and transparent as possible, and each axiom should have an immediate intuitive meaning by which its appropriateness can be judged directly.

To illustrate the strong feelings of independence which, as a part of the old traditions, are so characteristic of the English spirit, I should like to tell how Hardy and Littlewood, when they planned and began their far-reaching and intensive team work, still had some misgivings about it because they feared that it might encroach on their personal freedom, so vitally important to them. Therefore, as a safety measure, … they amused themselves by formulating some so-called &#8216;axioms&#8217; for their mutual collaboration. There were in all four such axioms.
</p>
<p>
The first of them said that, when one wrote to the other, …, it was completely indifferent whether what they wrote was right or wrong …
</p>
<p>
The second axiom was to the effect that, when one received a letter from the other, he was under no obligation whatsoever to read it, let alone to answer it …
</p>
<p>
The third axiom was to the effect that, although it did not really matter if they both thought about the same detail, still, it was preferable that they should not do so.
</p>
<p>
And, finally, the fourth, and perhaps most important axiom, stated that it was quite indifferent if one of them had not contributed the least bit to the contents of a paper under their common name …
</p>
<p>
I think one may safely say that seldom — or never — was such an important and harmonious collaboration founded on such apparently negative axioms.

&#8220;Ignorance of axioms&#8221;, the Lecturer continued, &#8220;is a great drawback in life. It wastes so much time to have to say them over and over again. For instance, take the Axiom, &#8216;<i>Nothing is greater than itself</i>,&#8217; that is, &#8216;<i>Nothing can contain itself</i>.&#8217; How often you hear people say &#8216;He was so excited, he was quite unable to contain himself.&#8217; Why, <i>of course</i> he was unable! The <i>excitement</i> had nothing to do with it!&#8221;

To solve the problem of what is mathematical truth, Poincaré said, we should first ask ourselves what is the nature of geometric axioms. Are they synthetic <i>a priori</i> judgments, as Kant said? That is, do they exist as a fixed part of man&#8217;s consciousness, independently of experience and uncreated by experience? Poincaré thought not. They would then impose themselves on us with such force that we couldn&#8217;t conceive the contrary proposition, or build upon it a theoretic edifice. There would be no non-Euclidean geometry.
</p>
<p>
Should we therefore conclude that the axioms of geometry are eternal verities? Poincaré didn&#8217;t think that was so either. If they were, they would be subject to continual change and revision as new laboratory data came in. This seemed to be contrary to the whole nature of geometry itself.
</p>
<p>
Poincaré concluded that the axioms of geometry are <i>conventions</i>, our choice among all possible conventions is <i>guided</i> by experimental facts, but it remains <i>free</i> and is limited only by the necessity of avoiding all contradiction. Thus it is that the postulates can remain rigorously true even though the experimental laws that have determined their adoption are only approximative. The axioms of geometry, in other words, are merely disguised definitions.

There are mathematicians who say that three plus one is a <i>tautology</i> for four, a <i>different way of saying</i> &#8220;four&#8221; … If three plus one can be two, or fourteen, then reason is madness.

We have learned to pass with such facility from cardinal to ordinal number that the two aspects appear to us as one. To determine the plurality of a collection, that is, its cardinal number, we do not bother anymore to find a model collection with which we can match it — we count it. And to the fact that we have learned to identify the two aspects of number is due our progress in mathematics . . .  The operations of arithmetic are based on the tacit assumption that we can always pass from any number to its successor, and this is the essence of  the ordinal concept.
</p>
<p>
And so matching by itself is incapable of creating an art of reckoning.  Without our ability to arrange things in ordered succession little progress could have been made. Correspondence and succession, the two principles that permeate all mathematics — nay, all realms of exact thought — are woven into the very fabric of our number system.

What seems universally acceptable is that numbers are inconceivable—practically, experientially, conceptually, semiotically, historically—in the absense of <em>counting</em>. Counting, whether with fingers, pebbles, notches, tally marks, abacus beads, or notations on chalkboards, paper, and computer screens, is an activiity involving <em>signs</em>. And, as an activity, counting works through—it <em>is</em>—significant repetition. How are we—through what discursive apparatus and technology of symbolic persuasion—to immagine the business of repeating the self-same signifying act without end, of iterating <em>for ever</em>? Or, which will come to the same, what would it mean to <em>deny</em> the possibility of endlessly repeating a signifying act? Is it in fact possible to coherently imagine an activity of iterating that did not—by definition of the very abstracted purity of the repetition that furthers it—go on forever?

For example, how significant it is that in the Indo-European languages, as Darmsteter has pointed out, the root meaning &#8220;two&#8221; should connote badness.  The Greek prefix dys- (as in dyspepsia) and the Latin dis- (as in dishonorable) are both derived from &#8220;duo&#8221;. The cognate bis- gives a pejorative sense to such modern French words as <i>bévue</i> (&#8220;blunder&#8221;, literally &#8220;two-sight&#8221;). Traces of that &#8220;second which leads you astray&#8221; can be found in &#8220;dubious&#8221;, &#8220;doubt&#8221;, and <i>Zweifel</i> — for to doubt is to be double-minded.

There are so many things you can do to a number, and as many reasons why you might want to. Add it, subtract it, cube it, expose it to all the contortions of mathematics. You could even, long ago, count things with it.  But you couldn&#8217;t steal it. But then again, you wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to.

Times change, and there is a new mathematics of number. In the new mathematics, the digits themselves, though crucial, no longer convey the number&#8217;s value.  In this new order, a small four-digit number, though numerically inferior in all respects to an infinite number of numbers above it, may be much more valuable.
</p>
<p>
A PIN, for example — an access code, the power to get wealth or credit or information — is worth many times more than the 11-digit telephone number of a pizza delivery outlet, even one that claims to use real mozzarella. The new situation is that a number&#8217;s true value can no longer be separated from its place in the world.
</p>
<p>
So the new mathematics, that is, the useful mathematics, has a calculus quite different from its predecessor. It still has ordering functions, and the concept of value but the number line has become a cloud of shifting points, tied up almost unfathomably with the world in which they exist.

Augustine took from the Neoplatonists that interest in number, which to the ordinary reader of his works seems an idiosyncrasy. … Plato, influenced by the Pythagoreans, tended towards the end of his life to see the ideal world—reality—as made up of mathematical concepts and symbols, which were therefore the metaphysical constituents of the visible universe. Plotinus adopted the conception, probably from the Neo-Pythagoreans, and Augustine in turn took it from the Neoplatonists.  For him number is the intelligible formula which describes the qualities of being and the manner of change, so that all chage throughout the universe, which presents so much philosophical difficulty, can in a sense be &#8216;controlled&#8217; by numbers, just as an algebraic formula might express an electrical transformation or an engineering stress. Numbers are, in fact, a rationalization of the seminal reason of things. Numbers as used by Augustine had, of course, no scientific or mathematical basis, and it was easy, as Augustine found, to allegorize them, but the rational, or at least the pseudo-rational, foundation for what seems to many to be a strange aberration of a great genius can be seen to be one more legacy from Neoplatonism.

The idea that area and volume would be discrete had come to me in a flash as I was trying to calculate the volume of some quantum geometry, while I was sitting for an hour in a noisy room in a garage waiting for my car to be fixed. The page of my notebook was filled with many messy integrals, but all of a sudden I saw emerge a formula for counting. I had begun to calculate a quantity on the assumption that the result was a real number, but found instead that, in certain units, all the possible answers would be integers. This meant that areas and volumes cannot take any value, but come in multiples of fixed units.

At the end of the thirteenth century, Raymond Lully was prepared to solve all arcana by means of an apparatus of concentric, revolving disks of different sizes, divided into sectors with Latin words; John Stuart Mill, at the beginning of the nineteenth, feared that some day the number of musical combinations would be exhausted and there would be no place in the future for indefinite Webers and Mozarts; Kurd Lasswitz, at the end of the nineteenth, toyed with the staggering fantasy of a universal library which would register all the variations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols, in other words, all that it is given to express in all languages. Lully&#8217;s machine, Mill&#8217;s fear and Lasswitz&#8217;s chaotic library can be the subject of jokes, but they exaggerate a propensity which is common: making metaphysics and the arts into a kind of play with combinations.

Some of the particulars recommended by Abulafia contributed to the aura of magic surrounding Kabbalah: the best hour for meditative permutations (known as tzeruf) was midnight. The meditator was to light many candles, wear phylacteries and a prayer shawl, and write out the permutations of the alphabet with ever increasing speed.  The resulting ecstatic state accompanied by the desire of the soul to leave the body could be so powerful that there was even the possibility of death. At the peak of ecstatic experience there would be a rush of unintelligible language and the kabbalist had to envision a surrounding circle of angels who could help to decipher the divine message. It was the sheer force of the letters themselves which brought forth the meaning, since the only link between the Sephirot of non-verbal Wisdom and verbal Intelligence was through the letters of the alphabet.

Why waste time marking out the hyperspace of possibilities when we already know where the good stuff is?

There is exact science in two branches: the Analysis of the necessary <em>Laws</em> of Thought, and the Analysis of the necessary <em>Matter</em> of Thought. The necessary matter of thought, that without which we cannot think, consists of Space and Time. These exist everywhere, and we can imagine no thought without them. Space and time are the <em>only</em> necessary matters of thought. These form the subject matter of the Mathematics. The consideration of the necessary <em>Laws</em> of thought, on the other hand, constitutes Logic.

Reasoning and logic are to each other as health is to medicine, or — better — as conduct is to morality. Reasoning refers to a gamut of natural thought processes in the everyday world. Logic is how we ought to think if objective truth is our goal — and the everyday world is very little concerned with objective truth. Logic is the science of the justification of conclusions we have reached by natural reasoning. My point here is that, for such natural reasoning to occur, consciousness is not necessary. The very reason we need logic at all is because most reasoning is not conscious at all.

Reason and logic are tools for understanding the world. We need a means of understanding ourselves, too. That is what imagination allows. When a child reads of a Nightingale who bleeds her song into a rose for love&#8217;s sake, or of a Selfish Giant who puts a wall round life, or of a Fisherman who wants to be rid of his Soul, or of a statue who feels the suffering of the world more keenly than the Mathematics Master who scoffs at his pupils for dreaming about Angels, the child knows at once both the mystery and truth of such stories.

The standard &#8220;foundation&#8221; for mathematics starts with sets and their elements. It is possible to start differently, by axiomatising not elements of sets but functions between sets. This can be done by using the language of categories and universal constructions.
</p>
<p align="center">&#8211;oo&#8211;</p>
<p>
… in one sense a foundation is a security blanket: If you meticulously follow the rules laid down, no paradoxes or contradictions will arise. In reality there is now no guarantee of this sort of security …
</p>
<p align="center">&#8211;oo&#8211;</p>
<p>
… the membership relation for sets can often be replaced by the composition operation for functions. This leads to an alternative foundation for Mathematics upon categories — specifically, on the category of all functions. Now much of Mathematics is dynamic, in that it deals with morphisms of an object into another object of the same kind. Such morphisms (like functions) form categories, and so the approach via categories fits well with the objective of organizing and understanding Mathematics. That, in truth, should be the goal of a proper philosophy of Mathematics.

Nowadays, one of the most interesting points in mathematics is that, although all categorical reasonings are formally contradictory, we use them and we never make a mistake. Grothendieck provided a partial foundation in terms of universes but a revolution of the foundations similar to what Cauchy and Weierstrass did for analysis is still to arrive. In this respect, he was pragmatic: categories are useful and they give results so we do not have to look at subtle set-theoretic questions if there is no need. Is today the moment to think about these problems? Maybe …

It seems to us however that mathematics has now reached the stage where formalisation within some particular axiomatic set theory is irrelevant, even for foundational studies. It should be possible to specify conditions on a mathematical theory which would suffice for embeddability within ZF (supplemented by additional axioms of infinity of necessary) but which do not otherwise restrict the possible constructions in that theory. Of course the conditions would apply to ZF itself, and to other possible theories that have been proposed as suitable foundations for mathematics (certain theories of categories, etc.), but would not restrict us to any particular theory. This appendix is in fact a cry for a Mathematicians&#8217; Liberation Movement!

The situation is analogous to the theory of vector spaces. Once upon a time there were collections of <i>n</i>-tuples of numbers, and the interesting theorems were those that remained invariant under linear transformations of these numbers. Now even the initial definitions are invariant, and vector spaces are defined by axioms rather than as particular objects. However, it is proved that every vector space has a base, so that the new theory is much the same as the old. But now no particular base is distinguished, and usually arguments which distinguish particular bases are cumbrous and inelegant compared to arguments directly in terms of the axioms.
</p>
<p>
We believe that mathematics itself can be foundsd in an invariant way, which would be equivalent to, but would not involve, formalisation within some theory such as ZF. No particular axiomatic theory like ZF would be needed, and indeed attempts to force arbitrary theories into a single formal straitjacket will probably continue to produce unnecessarily cumbrous and inelegant contortions.

&#8220;You know, many years ago — back in the 1930&#8217;s — I thought I was interested in the foundations of mathematics. I even wrote a paper or two in the area. We had a brilliant young logician on our faculty who was making a name for himself. One term I happened to lecture in the same classroom, the hour immediately after he did. Each day, before erasing the blackboard, I would take a look to see what he was up to.  Well, in September he started out with Theorem 1. Shortly before Christmas he was up to Theorem 747. You know what it was? &#8216;If <i>x</i>≤<i>y</i> and <i>y</i>≤<i>z</i>, then <i>x</i>≤<i>z</i>&#8216;! At that point, something within me snapped. I said to myself, &#8216;There are some things in mathematics that you just have to take for granted!&#8217; And I never again had anything to do with the foundations of mathematics.&#8221;

The following is … a scientific principle of general application:

<p style="margin-left:30px;">
We are not allowed to affirm a statement to be true or to maintain that a certain thing exists, unless we are forced to do so either by its self-evidence or by revelation or experience or by a logical deduction from either a revealed truth or a proposition verified by observation.
</p>
<p>
That this is the real meaning of &#8220;Ockham&#8217;s razor&#8221; can be gathered from various texts in Ockham&#8217;s writings. It is quite often stated by Ockham in the form: &#8220;Plurality is not to be posited without necessity&#8221; (<i>Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate</i>), and also, though seldom: &#8220;What can be explained by the assumption of fewer things is vainly explained by the assumption of more things&#8221; (<i>Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora</i>). The form usually given, &#8220;Entities must not be multiplied without necessity&#8221; (<i>Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate</i>), does not seem to have been used by Ockham. What Ockham demands in his maxim is that everyone who makes a statement must have a sufficient reason for its truth … This principle of &#8220;sufficient reason&#8221; is epistemological or methodological, certainly not an ontological axiom.

Most of us are familiar with elementary group theory including the existence of Sylow subgroups and have, no doubt, taken pleasure in the construction of groups of order say <i>pq</i> and being both amazed at and delighted by how much can be accomplished by so little. Although it is not normally thought of as part of combinatorics, it is an eminent example of such, and one which tends to appeal also to people who are not of a combinatorial temperament because it concerns individual objects with intricate structures. At the turn of the century, it had reached a high state of sophistication with the theory of group representations and characters, and the seminal works of Burnside and his conjectures.</p>
<p>Thompson came onto the scene together with Feit in the early 1960s by showing that every simple group is of even order (thus every group of odd order is solvable), which set a precedent for long and intricate papers in the field. This is taken as a point of departure for the report on Thompson&#8217;s work.  With the kind of long and involved chains of combinatorial reasoning that goes with group theory, and which seldom can be conceptually summarised, such a survey cannot hope to give anything more than a taste for the subject.

Tits&#8217; work also connects with finite groups (after all it was a shared award) but he also goes beyond it. As a starter, we can consider a problem he encountered and solved at the age of 16. We all know that the Moebius group acts triply transitively on the Riemann sphere. But this works not only for the complex numbers but for any field, in particular finite fields. What if we have a finite group acting triply transitively? Does it occur in that way, i.e. acting projectively on the projective line over a finite field? This is not quite so simple but if we add that the stabiliser of two points is commutative, mimicking the 1-parameter subgroup in the classical case, it goes through.  To understand a group we need to see it in action. One may radically summarise the interest of Tits as providing geometrical structures on which groups are made to act – thus the reverse of the Erlangen programme. One of his more mature challenges was to give suggestive geometric interpretations to the exceptional Lie groups. Out of this, his elaborate theory with characteristic real estate terminology has evolved.

For instance, there exists a theory, the theory of groups, the importance of which, in our science, grew increasingly for more than one century, especially since the work of Sophus Lie at the end of the nineteenth century. Some mathematicians, especially contemporary ones, have improved it by most beautiful discoveries. Some others—I confess that I belong to the latter category—though being eventually able to use it for simple applications, feel insuperable difficulty in mastering more than a rather elementary and superficial knowledge of it. Psychological reasons for that difference, which seems to me incontestable, would be interesting to find.

The understanding painter, describing a battle in lively colours, lets not his hand fall so low as the single encounters of mercenaries, light sallies of a desperate troop, nor to the exposure of every common man&#8217;s life, though it were in the very mouth of the cannon, for they would be base and idle descensions and not worth the labour of a deserving pencil, but neglecting these he strives only to express the valour of chieftains and generals, the arraigning of battles, overthrow of armies, devastation of cities, conflict of nations, and in the end the triumphs of the returning conquerors. So the Statist that desires to look through a Kingdom must not cast his eye upon humble and abject matters, and so be drawn from the greater, but even at the first let him take measure of the highest, which knowledge making him inwardly acquainted with foreign countries thrives so well in him that at last he grows to be a counsellor in his own.

A person who has watched her mother die from Huntington&#8217;s disease knows she has a fifty per cent chance of contracting it. But that is not right, is it?

So all that a genetic test does is unpackage the risk and tell her whether her ostensible risk is actually one hundred per cent or is actually zero.

No manager can make an experiment come out as they wish. The fact of the matter is that it’s impossible to manage research. If you want real innovation you have to tolerate lots and lots of failure. “Performance management” is an oxymoron. Get used to it.

The method of the physical sciences is based upon the induction which leads us to expect the recurrence of a phenomenon when the circumstances which give rise to it are repeated. If all the circumstances could be simultaneously reproduced, this principle could be fearlessly applied; but this never happens; some of the circumstances will always be missing. Are we absolutely certain that they are unimportant? Evidently not! It may be probable, but it cannot be rigorously certain. Hence the importance of the rôle that is played in the physical sciences by the law of probability. The calculus of probabilities is therefore not merely a recreation, or a guide to the baccarat player; and we must thoroughly examine the principles on which it is based.

The idea is sometimes expressed that one could improve observational accuracy by averaging. The dangers invited by such averaging were well known to statisticians. One has to keep separate the error term (variation) in observations and the numerical accuracy of the readings. The last significant digit of a single observation is the last significant digit of the average. Hence this way, too, is barred from leading to unlimited precision.

When Lludd told his brother the purpose of his errand Llevelys said that he already knew why Lludd had come. Then they sought some different way to discuss the problem, so that the wind would not carry it off and the Corannyeid learn of their conversation. Llevelys ordered a long horn of bronze to be made, and they spoke through that, but whatever one said to the other came out as hateful and contrary. When Llevelys perceived there was a devil frustrating them and causing trouble he ordered wine to be poured through the horn to wash it out, and the power of the wine drove the devil out.

The method involved a rod of olive-wood about a span and a half in length, around which was obliquely wrapped a bit of skin; on this the message was written,  from top to bottom, in such a way that when the skin was unrolled only detached letters appeared, and to read the message the recipient had to roll the skin again around a rod of the same dimensions.

Idealists and metaphysicists not only fall into confusion in their attempts to answer these basic questions but they go so far as to distort mathematics completely, turning it literally inside out. Thus, seeing the extreme abstractness and cogency of mathematical results, the idealist imagines that mathematics issues from pure thought.
</p>
<p>
In reality, mathematics offers not the slightest support for idealism or metaphysics. We will convince ourselves of this as we attempt, in general outline, to answer the listed questions about the essence of mathematics. For a preliminary clarification of these questions, it is sufficient to examine the foundations of arithmetic and elementary geometry, to which we now turn.

The entire mathematical community would become much more productive if we open our eyes to the real values in what we are doing. Jaffe and Quinn propose a system of recognized roles divided into &#8220;speculation&#8221; and &#8220;proving&#8221;. Such a division only perpetuates the myth that our progress is measured in units of standard theorems deduced. This is a bit like the fallacy of the person who makes a printout of the first 10,000 primes. What we are producing is human understanding. We have many different ways to understand and many different processes that contribute to our understanding. We will be more satisfied, more productive, and happier if we focus on this.

We would not go so far as to say that the passion with which these young Russian students thought day and night about mathematical questions was unique; the same passion could be found in the corridors of mathematics departments in Cambridge, Bonn, Berkeley, Paris, and elsewhere. One characteristic of the Russian approach, however, stood out — the conviction of the best Russian teachers of mathematics that the most fruitful attack on problems was direct and straightforward, without any preliminary, long, heavy readings. In other words, <i>start from scratch</i>.  By doing so, one got an almost physical feeling of being directly in contact with mathematical objects and experienced the sensual pleasure of having to fight intellectually with one&#8217;s bare hands. One of the great mathematicians of the time, Israel Moissevich Gelfand, would tell his young students, &#8220;We should study this topic before it has been tainted by handling.&#8221;

… the professors [at Bologna] were kept in absolute and even humiliating subservience to their students.  They had to swear obedience to the student rectors and to the student-made statutes, which bore very hardly upon them, e.g. the professor was fined if he began his teaching a minute late or continued a minute longer than the fixed time, and should this happen the students who failed to leave the lecture-room immediately were themselves fined. In addition, the professor was fined if he shirked explaining a difficult passage, or if he failed to get through the syllabus; he was fined if he left the city for a day without the rector&#8217;s permission, and if he married, was allowed only one day off for the purpose. The city, for its part, took a hand in controlling the professors, and they were forced to take an oath not to leave Bologna in search of more lucrative or less onerous posts.

Astrologers … were suspect because of their mathematical calculations. The memory of Roger Bacon had been besmirched by the assumption that mathematics was part of the black art, and it was notorious that the Edwardian reformers had destroyed mathematical manuscripts at Oxford under the delusion that they were conjuring books.  &#8220;Where a red letter or a mathematical diagram appeared, they were sufficient to entitle the book to be Popish or diabolical.&#8221; (This may account for the disappearance at this period of nearly all the works of the fourteenth-century Merton College school of astronomers.)

The evidence of title-pages … suggests that in seventeenth-century England the most usual meaning of &#8220;mathematician&#8221; was someone who made [astrological] predictions. That a mathematician was therefore a somewhat ambivalent figure is demonstrated by the rather hyperbolic example of <i>The ladies champion</i>, where John Heydon … attacked a series of pamphlets about prostitution. Heydon apparently felt that he had been slandered, and on his title-page he sarcastically gave himself all the bad names he could think of. One of these was &#8220;mathematician&#8221;.

I wanted to represent these [Fuchsian] functions by the quotient of two series; the idea was perfectly conscious and deliberate; the analogy with elliptic functions guided me. I asked myself what properties these series must have if they existed, and succeeded without difficulty in forming the series I have called thetafuchsian.

<p>
Just at this time, I left Caen, where I was living, to go on a geologic excursion under the auspices of the School of Mines. The incidents of travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go to some place or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. I did not verify the idea; I should not have had time, as, upon taking my seat in the omnibus, I went on with a conversation already commenced, but I felt a perfect certainty. On my return to Caen, for conscience&#8217;s sake I verified the result at my leisure.
</p>
<p>
Then I turned my attention to the study of some arithmetical questions apparently without much success and without a suspicion of any connection with my preceding researches. Disgusted with my failure, I went to spend a few days at the seaside and thought of something else. One morning, walking on the bluff, the idea came to me, with just the same characteristics of brevity, suddenness and immediate certainty, that the arithmetic transformations of indefinite ternary quadratic forms were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.

Perhaps I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of a journey through a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room of the mansion and it&#8217;s completely dark. You stumble around bumping into furniture, but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it&#8217;s all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the next room and spend another six months in the dark. So each of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they&#8217;re momentary, sometimes over a period of a day or two, they are the culmination of — and couldn&#8217;t exist without — the many months of stumbling around in the dark that preceded them.

At first I supposed that I should be able to overcome the contradiction quite easily, and that probably there was some trivial error in the reasoning.  Gradually, however, it became clear that this was not the case …  Throughout the latter half of 1901 I supposed the solution would be easy, but by the end of that time  I had concluded that it was a big job … I made a practice of wandering about the common room every night from eleven until one, by which time I came to know the three different noises made by nightjars. (Most people only know one.) I was trying hard to solve the contradiction. Every morning I would sit down before a blank sheet of paper.  Throughout the day, with a brief interval for lunch, I would stare at the blank sheet. Often when evening came it was still empty.

I recently had an odd and vivid experience. I had been struggling for months to prove a result I was pretty sure was true. When I was walking up a Swiss mountain, fully occupied by the effort, a very odd device emerged — so odd that, though it worked, I could not grasp the resulting proof as a whole. But not only so; I had a sense that my subconscious was saying, &#8220;Are you <i>never</i> going to get it, confound you; try this.&#8221;

It was at St Leonards, probably because it was a boarding school, that I discovered and developed as a positive habit the powers of what I call &#8220;subliminal learning&#8221;. We kept very regular hours and were never tired or stressed at school. Lights out at 9p.m., even when in the sixth form. Out of bed at 7a.m. The accepted wisdom is that one should relax before  going to bed, emptying the mind of problems. As far as mathematics is concerned I could not agree less. We looked forward to &#8220;drawing-room&#8221; each evening, but I usually cheated and stole ten minutes back at my desk before bathtime. I would make certain to sort out in my head, as late as possible, what problems needed to be solved the next day and what might be usefully committed to memory. Before falling asleep, I &#8220;drew&#8221; with my finger any relevant geometrical figure or algebraic equation on the partitioning of the dormitory cubicle that formed a bedside wall. The result would be miraculous. Without fail, on waking in the morning, the details, the logical argument required or the facts that I needed to recall were clearly imprinted in my mind and, because of the clarity, any required solution would often be clearly &#8220;written&#8221; on the partition. For this to work, it is essential to make sure to wake at least five or ten minutes before the prescribed time for getting out of bed, giving oneself time to go over what has been resolved while asleep.  This became honed to a fine art, without my ever telling anyone, and I have used the technique deliberately ever since.

One day when our family was having tea with some friends, he was enthusiastically talking about his work. He said: &#8220;I feel like I am somehow moving through outer space. A particular idea leads me to a nearby star on which I decide to land.  Upon my arrival I realize that somebody already lives there. Am I disappointed? Of course not. The inhabitant and I are cordially welcoming each other, and we are happy about our common discovery.&#8221; This was typical of my father; he was never envious.

If I was asked a question, rather a difficult one by itself, the result immediately proceeded from my sensibility without my knowing at the first moment how I had obtained it; starting from the result, I then sought the way to be followed for this purpose. That intuitive conception which, curiously enough, has never been shaken by an error, has developed more and more as needs increased. Even now, I have often the sensation of somebody beside me whispering the right way to find the desired result; it concerns some ways where few people have entered before me and which I should certainly not have found if I had sought for them by myself.

&#8220;But how do you DO research in mathematics?&#8221;, people often wonder. Even a distinguished laboratory scientist may be unable to comprehend how research can be possible without test-tubes, pipettes, and bubbling flasks of evil-smelling brews. Well, you scratch your head; you scratch the back of an envelope with a pencil; you scratch a blackboard with a piece of chalk. You lie in the bath and gaze alternately at the ceiling and at your navel. You do the washing-up or go to sleep and you leave your subconscious to do your thinking for you – often astonishingly successfully. And a good old screaming-match with your colleagues can sometimes help too.

Most of us might often liken much of our research to climbing a steep hill against a stiff breeze: every so often we stumble and roll to the bottom, but with persistence we eventually reach the summit and plant our flag amongst the others already there. And before our bruises fade and bones mend, we&#8217;re off to the next hill. But perhaps research in its purest form is more like chasing squirrels. As soon as you spot one and leap towards it, it darts away, zigging and zagging, always just out of reach. If you&#8217;re a little lucky, you might stick with it long enough to see it climb a tree. You&#8217;ll never catch the damned squirrel, but chasing it will lead you to a tree. In mathematics, the trees are called theorems. The squirrels are those nagging little mysteries we write at the top of many sheets of paper. We never know where our question will take us, but if we stick with it, it&#8217;ll lead us to a theorem. That I think is what research ideally is like.

I&#8217;m very, very concentrated on the problem I happen to work on and I am very selective. And I find it very hard to even take my mind off it enough to look at any of the flowers around, so I don&#8217;t think that either of the descriptions quite fits.

Most mathematicians  have heard the story of how Hamilton invented the quaternions. In 1835, at the age of 30, he had discovered how to treat complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. Fascinated by the relation between <b>C</b> and 2-dimensional geometry, he tried for many years to invent a bigger algebra that would play a similar role in 3-dimensional geometry. In modern language, it seems he was looking for a 3-dimensional normed division algebra. His quest built to its climax in October 1843. He later wrote to his son, &#8220;Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month, on my coming down to breakfast, your (then) little brother William Edwin, and yourself, used to ask me, &#8216;Well, papa, can you <em>multiply</em> triplets?&#8217; Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head: &#8216;No, I can only <em>add</em> and subtract them&#8217;.&#8221; The problem, of course, was that there exists no 3-dimensional normed division algebra. He really needed a 4-dimensional algebra.
</p>
<p>
Finally, on the 16th of October, 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal to a meeting of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, he made his momentous discovery. &#8220;That is to say, I then and there felt the galvanic circuit of thought <em>close</em>; and the sparks which fell from it were the <em>fundamental equations between i, j, k; exactly such</em> as I have used them ever since.&#8221; And in a famous act of mathematical vandalism, he carved these equations into the stone of the Brougham Bridge:
</p>
<p align="center">
<i>i</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>j</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>k</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>ijk</i> = −1.

There is a strong parallel between mountain climbing and mathematics research. When first attempts on a summit are made, the struggle is to find any route. Once on the top, other possible routes up may be discerned and sometimes a safer or shorter route can be chosen for the descent or for subsequent ascents. In mathematics the challenge is finding a proof in the first place. Once found, almost any competent mathematician can usually find an alternative often much better and shorter proof. At least in mountaineering we know that the mountain is there and that, if we can find a way up and reach the summit, we shall triumph. In mathematics we do not always know that there is a result, or if the proposition is only a figment of the imagination, let alone whether a proof can be found.

The spirit of mathematics and the essence of its beauty are remarkably fragile, because mathematics is about ideas and about thought. Mathematics takes place in the mind, and no two minds are the same. After many years of study and work, a mathematician may stumble on a vast and beautiful vista that unifies and simplifies many things that once appeared disparate and complicated. Mathematicians can share a beautiful vista with one another, but there is no camera that can easily capture an image of such a vista to convey it in full to people who have not trudged along many of the same trails.

Mathematics is a hard thing to love. It has the unfortunate habit, like a rude dog, of turning its most unfavourable side towards you when you first make contact with it. That unfavourable side is arithmetic, and most people never really get the legacy of that initial encounter off their fingers — which is where counting starts, and for most, where it remains.  Perhaps such an unwelcoming exterior serves a useful purpose — it deters casual visitors from stumbling into the awesome discoveries that lie beyond. Mathematics: you can get lost in such a beautiful place; unlike the real world, it has a purity that makes even simulated reality seem grubby; it is devoid of arbitrary construction in the same way the real world used to be, before people learned to tear natural things down and throw unnatural things up. It is the best wilderness in which to retreat, to fast, to search for enlightenment. It is, paradoxically, about the only place where you can really take refuge from the modern world&#8217;s unrelenting barrage of numbers.  But only mathematicians, and the various subspecies and half-breeds thereof, go there, which might be another reason why it is so  unpopular with almost everyone else.

We were to found a University magazine. A pair of little, active brothers—Livingstone by name, great skippers on the foot, great rubbers of the hands, who kept a book-shop over against the University building—had been debauched to play the part of publishers. We four were to be conjuct editors and, what was the main point of the concern, to print our own works; while, by every rule of arithmetic—that flatterer of credulity—the adventure must succeed and bring great profit. Well, well : it was a bright vision.

Luckily for [my father], I was, as he had been, an enthusiastic learner, eager to sit beside him on the sofa and be shown how one solved simultaneous equations. It is true that mathematics didn&#8217;t lead anywhere, neither in his day nor in mine. It had got him a scholarship to Westminster and an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge. It got me a scholarship to Harrow (by mistake) and another to Stowe (which was what I really wanted) and then, later, one to Trinity. But after that, for both of us, our enthusiasm burned itself out. The exciting road we had been following had come to an end; almost the only prospect open to the mathematician was to become a mathematics master; and neither of us could have faced that.

Philosophy is written in this grand book the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.

The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance.  But the bee takes the middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy (science); for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and disgested. Therefore, from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never been made), much may be hoped.

The most captivating and imaginative painter to have lived since Giotto would certainly have been Paolo Uccello, if only he had spent as much time on human figures and animals as he spent, and wasted, on the finer points of perspective. Such details may be attractive and ingenious, but anyone who studies them excessively is squandering time and energy, choking his mind with difficult problems, and, often enough, turning a fertile and spontaneous talent into something sterile and laboured. Artists who devote more attention to perspective than to figures develop a dry and angular style and, moreover, they usually end up solitary, eccentric, melancholy, and poor, as indeed did Paolo Uccello himself. He was endowed by nature with a discriminating and subtle mind, but he found pleasure only in exploring certain difficult, or rather impossible, problems of perspective, which, although fanciful and attractive, hindered him so much when he came to paint figures that the older he grew the worse he did them.

You can see [the meaning of the statement that &#8220;Literature is a living art&#8221;] most easily and clearly, perhaps, by contrasting Science and Art at their two extremes — say Pure Mathematics and Acting. Science as a rule deals with things, Art with man&#8217;s thought and emotion about things. In Pure Mathematics things are rarefied into ideas, numbers, concepts, but still further and further away from the individual man. Two and two make four, and fourpence is not ninepence (or at any rate four is not nine) whether Alcibiades or Cleon keep the tally. In Acting on the other hand almost everything depends on personal interpretation — on the gesture, the walk, the gaze, the tone of a Siddons, the <i>rusé</i> smile of a Coquelin, the exquisite, vibrant intonation of a Bernhardt. &#8216;English Art?&#8217; exclaimed Whistler, &#8216;there is no such thing! Art is art and mathematics is mathematics.&#8217; Whistler erred.  Precisely because Art is Art, and Mathematics is Mathematics and a Science, Art being Art can be English or French; and more than this, must be the personal expression of an Englishman or a Frenchman, as a &#8216;Constable&#8217; differs from a &#8216;Corot&#8217; and a &#8216;Whistler&#8217; from both.

The arts, like arithmetic and geometry, turn away their eyes from the gross, coloured and mobile nature at our feet, and regard instead a certain figmentary abtraction. Geometry will tell us of a circle, a thing never seen in nature; asked about a green circle or an iron circle, it lays its hand upon its mouth. So with the arts. Painting, ruefully comparing sunshine and flake-white, gives up truth of colour, as it had already given up relief and movement; and instead of vying with nature, arranges a scheme of harmonious tints. Literature, above all in its most typical mood, the mood of narrative, similarly flees the direct challenge and pursues instead an independent and creative aim … A proposition of geometry does not compete with life; and a proposition of geometry is a fair and luminous parallel for a work of art. Both are reasonable, both untrue to the crude fact; both inhere in nature, neither represents it.

It is obvious that mathematics needs both sorts of mathematicians [theory-builders and problem-solvers] … It is equally obvious that different branches of mathematics require different aptitudes. In some, such as algebraic number theory, or the cluster of subjects now known simply as Geometry, it seems … to be important for many reasons to build up a considerable expertise and knowledge of the work that other mathematicians are doing, as progress is often the result of clever combinations of a wide range of existing results. Moreover, if one selects a problem, works on it in isolation for a few years and finally solves it, there is a danger, unless the problem is very famous, that it will no longer be regarded as all that significant.

At the other end of the spectrum is, for example, graph theory, where the basic object, a graph, can be immediately comprehended.  One will not get anywhere in graph theory by sitting in an armchair and trying to understand graphs better. Neither is it particularly necessary to read much of the literature before tackling a problem: it is of course helpful to be aware of some of the most important techniques, but the interesting problems tend to be open precisely because the established techniques cannot easily be applied.

Of the properties of mathematics, as a language, the most peculiar one is that by playing formal games with an input mathematical text, one can get an output text which seemingly carries new knowledge. The basic examples are furnished by scientific or technological calculations: general laws plus initial conditions produce predictions, often only after time-consuming and computer-aided work. One can say that the input contains an implicit knowledge which is thereby made explicit. One could try to find a parallel in the humanities by comparing this to hermeneutics: the art of finding hidden meanings of sacred texts. Legal discourse, too, has some common traits with scientific discourse. In the course of history, the modern language of science slowly emerged from these two archaic activities, and it still owes a lot to them, especially in the more descriptive and less mathematicised domains.

First, I want to quote a definition of what is mathematics due to Davis and Hersh … &#8220;The study of mental objects with reproducible properties is called mathematics.&#8221; I love this definition because it doesn&#8217;t try to limit mathematics to what has been called mathematics in the past but really attempts to say why certain communications are classified as math, others as science, others as art, others as gossip.  Thus reproducible properties of the physical world are science whereas reproducible mental objects are math. Art lives on the mental plane (the real painting is not the set of dry pigments on the canvas nor is a symphony the sequence of sound waves that convey it to our ear) but, as the post-modernists insist, is reinterpreted in new contexts by each appreciator. As for gossip, which includes the vast majority of our thoughts, its essence is its relation to a unique local part of time and space.

Tlön&#8217;s geometry is made up of two rather distinct disciplines — visual geometry and tactile geometry. Tactile geometry corresponds to our own, and is subordinate to the visual. Visual geometry is based on the surface, not the point; it has no parallel lines, and it claims that as one&#8217;s body moves through space, it modifies the shapes that surround it. The basis of Tlön&#8217;s arithmetic is the notion of indefinite numbers; it stresses the importance of the concepts &#8220;greater than&#8221; and &#8220;less than&#8221;, which our own mathematicians represent with the symbols &gt; and &lt;. The people of Tlön are taught that the act of counting modifies the amount counted, turning indefinites into definites. The fact that several persons counting the same quantity come to the same result is for the psychologists of Tlön an example of the association of ideas or of memorization.

The question [of whether boots or shoes are better for walking] may be pursued through all its ramfications; and no doubt those who like quantitative thinking could ultimately produce some sort of determination … Where comfort and utility only are concerned, the vulgar processes of comparing, adding and subtracting are quite sufficient to lead to a conclusion.

But quantitative reasoning, though invaluable in politics, is very poor fun.  Life would have little flavour without occasional qualitative excursions into the <i>a priori</i>.

Outside observers often assume that the more complicated a piece of mathematics is, the more mathematicians admire it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Mathematicians admire elegance and simplicity above all else, and the ultimate goal in solving a problem is to find the method that does the job in the most efficient manner. Though the major accolades are given to the individual who solves a particular problem first, credit (and gratitude) always goes to those who subsequently find a simpler solution.

Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.

In the applied mathematical textbooks current during my undergraduate days, the formal arguments were mostly tolerably sound (though often very irrelevant to current scientific progress). But their scientific philosophy was very often quite unsound and superficial, as witness the statement in one of them: &#8220;It is inconceivable that the original laws on which Mechanics is based could be erroneous.&#8221;

Did chemistry theorems exist? No: therefore you had to go further, not be satisfied with the <i>quia</i>, go back to the origins, to mathematics and physics. The origins of chemistry were ignoble, or at least equivocal: the dens of the alchemists, their abominable hodgepodge of ideas and language, their confessed interest in gold, their Levantine swindles typical of charlatans and magicians; instead, at the origin of physics lay the strenuous clarity of the West—Archimedes and Euclid.

There is no point in saying that one should not doubt or that one should believe. Just to say &#8220;I believe&#8221; does not mean that you understand and see. When a student works on a mathematical problem, he comes to a stage beyond which he does not know how to proceed, and where he is in doubt or perplexity. As long as he has this doubt, he cannot proceed. If he wants to proceed, he must resolve this doubt. And there are ways of resolving that doubt. Just to say &#8220;I believe&#8221;, or &#8220;I do not doubt&#8221;, will certainly not solve the problem. To force oneself to believe and to accept a thing without understanding is political, and not spiritual or intellectual.

As a Marxist mathematician, Kol&#8217;man insisted that human knowledge finds its origin in the material world, not in the minds of scientists.  Marx and Engels had written that mathematics arose in the ancient world when humans found it necessary to quantify material things like olive oil and grain, and to measure land in primitive surveying operations. Thus, for Marxists, mathematics was a science of material relationships. According to Kol&#8217;man, while some areas of mathematics may have become very abstract in modern times, the discipline never lost its contact with the exterior world.  He maintained that mathematics must be interpreted from the standpoint of philosophical materialism.
</p>
<p>
Opposed to this view, said Kol&#8217;man, was the &#8220;idealistic, religious&#8221; view that mathematics is merely created by human beings — that it is a product of their minds, without a necessary relationship to the material world. In a 1931 article Kol&#8217;man even used technical arguments about Luzin&#8217;s treatment of the continuum, saying that Luzin &#8220;eliminates all points with rational coordinates, which has even less to do with reality than absolute continuity&#8221;. Kol&#8217;man reproached Luzin for his &#8220;inability to understand the unity of continuous and discrete&#8221;. In his denunciation Kol&#8217;man accused Luzin of saying that numbers &#8220;exist as a function of the mind of the mathematician&#8221;. Here Kol&#8217;man was using the debate of twenty years earlier and Luzin&#8217;s anti-intuitionist inclinations to accuse the latter  of absolute idealism — the belief that a person gives a thing existence by thinking about it.

In my own professional work I have touched on a variety of different fields.  I&#8217;ve done work in mathematical linguistics, for example, without any professional credentials in mathematics; in this subject I am completely self-taught, and not very well taught. But I&#8217;ve often been invited by universities to speak on mathematical linguistics at mathematics seminars and colloquia. No one has ever asked me whether I have the appropriate credentials to speak on these subjects; the mathematicians couldn&#8217;t care less.  What they want to know is what I have to say. No one has ever objected to my right to speak, asking whether I have a doctor&#8217;s degree in mathematics, or whether I have taken advanced courses in this subject. That would never have entered their minds. They want to know whether I am right or wrong, whether the subject is interesting or not, whether better approaches are possible — the discussion dealt with the subject, not with my right to discuss it.
</p>
<p>
But on the other hand, in discussion and debate concerning social issues or American foreign policy, Vietnam or the Middle East, for example, the issue is constantly raised, often with considerable venom. I&#8217;ve repeatedly been challenged on grounds of credentials, or asked, what special training do you have that entitles you to speak of these matters. The assumption is that people like me, who are outsiders from a professional viewpoint, are not entitled to speak on such things.
</p>
<p>
Compare mathematics and the political sciences — it&#8217;s quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is the concern for content.

One evening I was in a group of people interested in psychology and religion, where a friend of mine gave a talk on the means of perceiving the qualitative reality of life. She helped illumine the meaning of life for her. I thought her talk excellent, but no sooner had she stopped speaking than she was pecked at from all sides:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How can you say that poetic experience is &#8216;real&#8217;? It cannot even be demonstrated mathematically, and what is expressible mathematically is the only true reality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How can you possibly say that you were &#8216;at one&#8217; with Nature when you had no proof that Nature was &#8216;at one&#8217; with you? It probably felt quite the contrary!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I was upset because it appeared so obvious to me that what my friend was talking about was not measurable at all by quantitative criteria. She used words which usually express space and time and solid substance, like <i>inner</i> and <i>outer</i> and <i>higher</i> and <i>lower</i> and <i>real</i> and <i>unreal</i>, because there were no other words for expressing what she meant. But she used them symbolically and qualitatively, not with their usual quantitative and spatial connotations; and because of this, her meaning was not apparent to her listeners. They were really quite nasty to her, and when I tried to come to her defence, I was pecked at too.  When I said that they had not understood the qualitative reality which my friend had been talking about, they quite justifiably pointed out that I, not understanding mathematics, was ignorant of what they knew was reality.

Knowing it intellectually, knowing it inferentially, she has worked out strategies to deal with her imperception. She cannot look left, directly, she cannot turn left, so what she does is to turn right – and right through a circle … if she cannot find something which she knows should be there, she swivels to the right, through a circle, until it comes into view. … If her portions seem too small, she will swivel to the right, keeping her eyes to the right, until the previously missed half now comes into view; she will eat this, or rather half of this, and feel rather less hungry than before. But if she is still hungry, or if she thinks on the matter, and realises that she may have only perceived half of the missing half, she will make a second rotation until the remaining quarter comes into view, and, in turn, bisect this yet again. This usually suffices – after all, she has how eaten seven-eighths of the portion – but she may, if she is feeling particularly hungry or obsessive, make a third turn, and secure another sixteenth of her portion (leaving, of course, the remaining sixteenth, the left sixteenth, on her plate). &#8220;It&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I feel like Zeno&#8217;s arrow – I never get there …&#8221;

Mathematics is ultimately no more but no less than thinking very clearly about something. I like puzzles, so I am a mathematician. I am not a pure mathematician&#8217;s mathematician because I don&#8217;t like abstract, formal problems. I like tricks and devices. I am essentially a mathematician but in the sense that I like thinking about complicated things, asking what are potential simplicities hidden in them and expressing that tentative thought in mathematical terms and seeing where it leads me in testable ways.
